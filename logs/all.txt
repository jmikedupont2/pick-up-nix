+# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Git Commit Messages
+
+**Document ID:** PI-SOP-003, Rev 1.0 (Placeholder ID)
+**Applicable Standards:** Git Best Practices, Project Readability
+
+---
+
+## 1.0 Purpose
+
+To define a consistent and clear standard for writing Git commit messages within this project. Adhering to this SOP ensures that commit history is readable, informative, and easily searchable, facilitating collaboration and project understanding.
+
+## 2.0 Scope
+
+This SOP applies to all Git commits made within the `pick-up-nix` repository and its submodules.
+
+## 3.0 Principles of a Good Commit Message
+
+A good commit message serves several purposes:
+*   **Explains *why* the change was made, not just *what* was changed.**
+*   **Provides context for future readers (including your future self).**
+*   **Facilitates code review and debugging.**
+*   **Contributes to a clean and understandable project history.**
+
+## 4.0 Procedure: Writing Commit Messages
+
+All commit messages **MUST** be written using a file, not directly inline with the `-m` flag, especially for multi-line messages or those requiring detailed explanations.
+
+### 4.1 Step 1: Stage Your Changes
+
+Before writing the commit message, ensure all relevant changes are staged using `git add`.
+
+```bash
+git add <files_or_directories>
+```
+
+### 4.2 Step 2: Create the Commit Message File
+
+Create a temporary file (e.g., `.git_commit_message.txt`) and write your commit message into it.
+
+**Format:**
+
+*   **First Line (Subject Line):** A concise summary of the change (50-72 characters). Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Fix: ...", "Feat: ...", "Chore: ...").
+*   **Second Line:** Always blank.
+*   **Subsequent Lines (Body):** A more detailed explanation of the change.
+    *   Explain the problem being solved.
+    *   Describe the approach taken.
+    *   Mention any relevant context, decisions, or trade-offs.
+    *   Use bullet points or paragraphs for readability.
+    *   Wrap lines at 72 characters.
+
+**Example Content for `.git_commit_message.txt`:**
+
+```
+feat: Implement new feature X
+
+This commit introduces feature X, which addresses the problem of Y.
+The implementation uses Z approach to achieve the desired outcome.
+
+- Added new module for X.
+- Updated configuration files.
+- Fixed related bug in A.
+```
+
+### 4.3 Step 3: Commit Using the File
+
+Use the `git commit -F` flag to read the commit message from the file.
+
+```bash
+git commit -F .git_commit_message.txt
+```
+
+### 4.4 Step 4: Clean Up (Optional but Recommended)
+
+After a successful commit, you can remove the temporary commit message file.
+
+```bash
+rm .git_commit_message.txt
+```
+
+## 5.0 Commit Message Types (Prefixes)
+
+Use the following prefixes for your subject line to categorize the type of change:
+
+*   **`feat:`**: A new feature.
+*   **`fix:`**: A bug fix.
+*   **`docs:`**: Documentation only changes.
+*   **`style:`**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semicolons, etc.).
+*   **`refactor:`**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
+*   **`perf:`**: A code change that improves performance.
+*   **`test:`**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
+*   **`chore:`**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files (e.g., build process, auxiliary tools, libraries).
+*   **`ci:`**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts.
+*   **`build:`**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies.
+*   **`revert:`**: Reverts a previous commit.

+# Change & Quality Request (CRQ): Formal Proof of ElizaOS Plugin Replacement
+
+**Document ID:** PI-CRQ-00X, Rev 1.0 (Placeholder ID)
+**Applicable Standards:** ISO 9001, ITILv4, C4 Model, GMP, Six Sigma, Agile, Formal Methods
+
+---
+
+## 1.0 Change Description (ITIL)
+
+This Change Request authorizes the initiation of a formal verification project for the replacement of ElizaOS TypeScript plugin functionality with WebAssembly (WASM)-compiled Rust code. This is a strategic change to enhance the reliability, security, and provable correctness of critical system components.
+
+## 2.0 Business Case (Agile)
+
+The current TypeScript implementation of ElizaOS plugins, while functional, lacks the strong guarantees of correctness and memory safety that Rust provides. Furthermore, the ability to formally prove the equivalence and correctness of the Rust replacement using Lean 4 will significantly reduce the risk of subtle bugs, improve system integrity, and establish a new standard for software quality within the project. This will increase developer confidence and reduce long-term maintenance costs.
+
+## 3.0 DMAIC Framework (Six Sigma)
+
+*   **Define:** The problem is the lack of formal guarantees for the correctness and behavior of ElizaOS TypeScript plugins, leading to potential vulnerabilities and unpredictable behavior. The **Customer** is any user or system relying on ElizaOS plugin functionality.
+*   **Measure:** We will measure the current state by analyzing existing bug reports related to ElizaOS plugins and the effort required for manual testing and debugging.
+*   **Analyze:** The root cause is the inherent limitations of dynamic languages like TypeScript in providing strong, provable guarantees about program behavior, especially concerning memory safety and type correctness.
+*   **Improve:** We will improve the system by replacing TypeScript components with Rust-based WASM modules and formally verifying their behavior using Lean 4. This will involve a 42-step verification process as outlined in `INTENT.md`.
+*   **Control:** We will control the improved process by integrating formal verification into our CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that all future changes to these critical components are also formally verified.
+
+## 4.0 Architectural Approach (C4)
+
+The replacement will involve developing Rust components that compile to WASM, designed to be binary-compatible with the existing TypeScript interfaces. The formal proof will be conducted using Lean 4, treating both the TypeScript and Rust codebases as inputs for conversion into a Lean-compatible representation.
+
+## 5.0 Quality & Compliance Statement (GMP/ISO 9001)
+
+This project will adhere to the highest standards of software quality and formal methods. All Rust code will be developed with a focus on memory safety and correctness. The formal verification process will provide a provable guarantee of functional equivalence and type compatibility, exceeding standard testing methodologies. This CRQ aligns with ISO 9001 principles for quality management and GMP guidelines for software development.

+# Project Intent: Formal Verification of WASM-based Rust Replacement for ElizaOS Plugins
+
+## Overarching Goal
+
+The primary objective is to replace the existing TypeScript (TS) functionality of ElizaOS plugins with WebAssembly (WASM)-compiled Rust code. This replacement aims for binary compatibility, ensuring seamless integration and equivalent behavior.
+
+## Formal Verification with Lean 4
+
+A critical aspect of this project is the formal verification of the Rust replacement code using the Lean 4 theorem prover. The goal is to rigorously prove the correctness and type compatibility of the Rust implementation against the original TypeScript functionality.
+
+## 42-Step Verification Process
+
+The formal verification process will be executed in a structured, 42-step approach, encompassing the following key phases:
+
+1.  **Rust Code Development:** Write the Rust code that implements the desired functionality, intended to replace the TypeScript components.
+2.  **TypeScript Introspection (Rust Parser):** Utilize a Rust-based parser to introspect and analyze the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and type information of the original TypeScript code.
+3.  **Rust to Lean Conversion:** Develop a mechanism or tool to convert the Rust code (or its relevant properties) into a representation understandable by Lean 4.
+4.  **TypeScript to Lean Conversion:** Develop a mechanism or tool to convert the TypeScript code (or its relevant properties) into a representation understandable by Lean 4.
+5.  **Type Compatibility Proofs in Lean 4:** For each function in the original TypeScript codebase, identify a corresponding function in the Rust replacement. Formally prove within Lean 4 that these Rust functions are type-compatible with their TypeScript counterparts, ensuring the correctness of the replacement.
+
+This ambitious process aims to achieve a high degree of confidence in the correctness and equivalence of the Rust-based WASM modules.

+# Livestreaming Setup and Indirect Control Mechanism
+
+This document details the complex technical setup used for livestreaming and the innovative method employed for indirect control and timestamping of the video feed.
+
+## 1. Core Environment
+
+Our primary development and streaming environment is a highly customized stack:
+
+*   **Operating System:** Linux
+*   **Android Layer:** Nix-on-Droid running on Android
+*   **AI Assistant:** Gemini (this AI) operates within this environment.
+
+## 2. Session Management
+
+*   **Tmux:** All development and streaming sessions are managed using `tmux`, ensuring persistent and organized workspaces.
+
+## 3. Display and Input
+
+*   **HDMI Adapter:** A physical HDMI adapter connects the Android device to a large external display.
+*   **Keyboard and Mouse:** Standard peripherals are connected for direct interaction with the Android/Linux environment.
+
+## 4. Video Feed Transmission (Android to PC)
+
+*   **RustDesk:** The video feed from the Android device (including the terminal output where Gemini operates) is streamed to a dedicated PC using RustDesk, a remote desktop software.
+
+## 5. PC-Side Broadcasting
+
+On the PC, the RustDesk feed is captured and processed by OBS Studio:
+
+*   **OBS Studio:** Used for video mixing, overlays, and routing the stream.
+*   **Restream.io:** OBS sends the consolidated stream to Restream.io, which then distributes it to multiple platforms:
+    *   X (formerly Twitter)
+    *   Rumble
+    *   Twitch
+
+## 6. TikTok Integration
+
+*   **TikTok Studio Live:** The final stream is fed into TikTok Studio Live. Crucially, our live video feed is displayed here, *along with the text output generated by Gemini*.
+
+## 7. Indirect Livestream Control and Timestamping (The "Banner Tool")
+
+Our method for indirect livestream control and video timestamping leverages the visual output of the `log_and_figlet.sh` script:
+
+*   **`log_and_figlet.sh`:** This script generates large, stylized text banners using `figlet`.
+*   **Visual Timestamping:** When `log_and_figlet.sh` is executed with a message, the `figlet` banner appears prominently in the terminal output, which is part of the video feed being streamed.
+*   **AI Recognition:** These distinct `figlet` banners serve as visual markers within the video stream. An AI (presumably on the user's side, analyzing the video feed) can easily recognize these banners.
+*   **Synchronization:** By detecting the appearance of specific banners, the AI can timestamp the video feed and synchronize events or actions with the development process being livestreamed.
+
+This approach allows for a robust, indirect method of coordinating the livestream and marking significant moments in the video, with future plans for more direct control.

    feat: Implement nix-introspector tool with 'evaluate' subcommand
    
    This commit introduces the initial version of the `nix-introspector` Rust tool.
    It includes the `evaluate` subcommand, which automates the process of:
    - Creating isolated experiment environments for Nix tools.
    - Generating `flake.nix` configurations for tool evaluation.
    - Vendorizing tools as Git submodules.
    - Copying and executing test cases against the evaluated tools.
    
    This feature aims to streamline the evaluation and analysis of Nix-based projects and tools.

    feat: Implement Executable Spec and Introspector Foundation
    
    This commit introduces a major architectural refactoring, establishing the foundation for the Nix Introspector project and the concept of "Executable Specifications".
    
    Key changes include:
    
    1.  **Project Refactoring:**
        -   Removed all NixOS-specific configurations.
        -   Refactored the flake to support Home Manager configurations for `x86_64-linux` and `aarch64-linux`.
        -   Introduced a modular `home/` directory for managing package sets (`base`, `emacs`, `scientific`).
        -   Populated home modules with packages from the legacy configuration.
    
    2.  **Nix Introspector Tool:**
        -   Initialized a new root-level Cargo project to act as a "task runner" and management CLI for the entire system.
        -   Created the `nix-inspector` binary within the `rnix-parser` submodule to parse and display the AST of Nix files.
    
    3.  **Executable Specification (`Escaped-RDFa/namespace`):**
        -   Added the `Escaped-RDFa/namespace` repository as a submodule.
        -   Transformed this submodule into a self-contained flake project.
        -   Implemented an `mdbook`-based static site build for its documentation.
        -   Added a placeholder for a machine-readable "smart contract" output.
    
    4.  **Process & Architectural Documentation:**
        -   Created several new documents to capture the project's vision, processes, and architecture (`ARCHITECTURAL_VISION.md`, `PROJECT_PROCESS.md`, etc.).

+# Architectural Vision: On-Chain Software Supply Chain Verification
+
+## 1.0 Core Concept
+
+The goal of this project is to create a system for producing cryptographically verifiable digital assets that represent software components. These assets, analogous to Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), will provide a complete, auditable history from source code to binary execution, creating a "proof-of-integrity" and a "proof-of-execution."
+
+## 2.0 The Digital Asset ("Smart Contract")
+
+Each version-controlled repository (e.g., a git submodule) is an instance of a "smart contract" with the following properties:
+
+*   **Identity:** The git URL and commit hash.
+*   **Metadata:** A link to its Nix derivation, which defines its dependencies and build process.
+*   **Authenticity:** A GPG signature from the author/maintainer.
+*   **Proof of Integrity:** The Nix NAR hash of its source code.
+*   **Proof of Execution:** A verifiable audit trace of its build process.
+
+## 3.0 The Proof Generation Pipeline
+
+### Phase 1: Observation & Indexing
+The `observe` command recursively scans all sources (local, git, etc.) and creates a structured, indexed catalog of all software components.
+
+### Phase 2: Build & Trace (eBPF)
+When a component is built using Nix, we will use **eBPF and binary instrumentation** to trace the entire execution of the build process. This trace will capture:
+*   All system calls made by the compiler and build tools.
+*   All file access, ensuring no undeclared dependencies are used.
+*   All network access, enforcing build purity.
+This captured trace serves as the **Proof of Execution**.
+
+### Phase 3: Attestation & Signing (GPG)
+The final build artifact (the binary) and its Proof of Execution trace are cryptographically hashed together. This final hash is the component's "attestation," which is then signed with the author's GPG key.
+
+### Phase 4: Minting (Blockchain)
+The GPG-signed attestation is then "minted" as a digital asset. The initial implementation will be a local registry, with the future goal of bridging these assets to public blockchains like Ethereum and Solana.
+
+## 4.0 Advanced Concepts: Injected Runtime Probes
+
+A future goal is to explore injecting a lightweight, user-space eBPF probe directly into the compiled binaries. This would allow the binary to produce a proof of its own execution at runtime, creating a fully self-verifying software artifact.

+# Nix Introspector: Core Concept
+
+This document outlines the core idea behind the `nix-introspector` tool.
+
+## The Core Idea: A Universal Nix Representation
+
+The central concept is to parse any Nix expression into a universal, intermediate representation, such as S-expressions (sexpr). This representation will serve as a lingua franca for build commands and configurations.
+
+The workflow would be:
+
+1.  **Parse:** Take any Nix file (`flake.nix`, `home.nix`, etc.) and parse it into a canonical `sexpr` form using the `rnix-parser` library.
+
+2.  **Transform:** From this `sexpr` representation, we can then generate equivalent commands or configurations for different systems:
+    *   Guix commands
+    *   Standard shell scripts
+    *   Other configuration formats
+
+## Philosophical Goal
+
+As a philosophical goal, this approach aims to document and model the fundamental "monadic form" of software dependency management: the process of moving from source code to a final, realized binary artifact. By translating between Nix and Guix, we explore the different "syntaxes" for this same underlying "monad" of package management.

+# Change Request: Component Integrity Verification
+
+**CRQ ID:** CRQ-002
+**Applicable Standards:** ISO 9001, ITILv4, C4 Model, GMP, Six Sigma
+
+---
+
+## 1.0 Change Description (ITIL)
+
+This document proposes a **Standard Change** to implement a new service: **Component Integrity Verification**. This service will provide automated, cryptographic proof of integrity for all third-party source code repositories (submodules) vendored into this project.
+
+## 2.0 Justification (Six Sigma)
+
+To achieve a Six Sigma level of quality and security, the risk of unverified or altered third-party code must be eliminated. This change directly addresses this potential cause of defects by introducing a robust, automated verification process, thus improving the security and reproducibility of the entire system.
+
+## 3.0 Proposed Change: The "Integrity Smart Contract"
+
+We will model the integrity of each component as a "Smart Contract." This provides a clear, verifiable agreement about the state of the code.
+
+### 3.1 The Contract Terms (GMP)
+The "Integrity Smart Contract" is a set of rules that a repository instance must adhere to. The primary term is:
+
+*   **Verifiable Integrity:** A repository's source code, when processed by the Nix hashing algorithm, MUST produce a specific, predetermined cryptographic hash (a NAR hash).
+
+### 3.2 The Contract Instance
+Each external repository added as a `git submodule` to this project is considered an **Instance** of this contract.
+
+### 3.3 The Oracle / Auditor (ISO 9001)
+The `nix flake check` command serves as the automated, impartial **Auditor** of the contract. When executed, it cryptographically verifies that the terms of the contract have been met for all instances. Any deviation is a **Non-conformance** and will cause the check to fail.
+
+## 4.0 Implementation Details (C4 Model)
+
+1.  **Component:** A new Nix function will be created. This function will take a repository path as input and produce a Nix derivation whose output is the NAR hash of that path. This is the core **Component** of the new service.
+2.  **Process:**
+    *   When a new submodule is added, it is registered in the `flake.nix`.
+    *   Its hash derivation is added to the `flake.nix#checks` attribute set. This is the act of deploying the "smart contract".
+    *   A badge is added to the main `README.md` for the submodule. The badge's URL will point to the `flake.nix` file itself, providing **Traceability** and public evidence of the integrity contract.
+
+## 5.0 Validation Plan (ISO 9001)
+
+This change will be considered **Validated** once:
+1.  The integrity check is implemented for the first instance (`Escaped-RDFa/namespace`).
+2.  The `nix flake check` command successfully executes and verifies the hash.
+3.  The corresponding badge is added to the `README.md`.

+# Project Process & Quality Plan: Nix-Introspector Initiative
+
+**Document ID:** PI-SOP-001, Rev 1.0
+**Applicable Standards:** ISO 9001, ITILv4, C4 Model, GMP, Six Sigma, Extreme Programming, Agile
+
+---
+
+## 1.0 Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): `observe` Command
+
+### 1.1 User Story (Agile)
+As a Nix Developer, I want to run an `observe` command so that I can get a unified Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation of all source code in the project, enabling deeper analysis and transformation.
+
+### 1.2 Process Definition (ISO 9001)
+This SOP defines the validated procedure for the `observe` command, which is a critical **Component (C4)** of the Nix-Introspector **Service (ITIL)**. The procedure ensures a consistent, repeatable parsing process with a defect rate approaching **Six Sigma** levels. All steps are traceable and subject to quality audit.
+
+### 1.3 System Context Diagram (C4)
+This diagram shows the high-level context of the `observe` command's operation.
+
+```plantuml
+@startuml
+!include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/master/C4_Context.puml
+Person(Developer, "Developer")
+System(Introspector, "Nix Introspector", "Parses and analyzes Nix/Guix codebases")
+SystemDb(SourceCode, "Code Repository", "Git repository with Nix files, Cargo files, etc.")
+Rel(Developer, Introspector, "Runs 'observe' command")
+Rel(Introspector, SourceCode, "Reads files from")
+@enduml
+```
+
+### 1.4 Procedure Steps (GMP/ITIL)
+1.  **Initiation:** The Developer initiates the process by executing `cargo run -- observe`. This constitutes a standard **Change Request (ITIL)** to the system state (from un-parsed to parsed).
+2.  **Input Validation (Six Sigma):** The `observe` command shall first validate its inputs. The primary input is the project's root directory. The process **Control Plan** requires that the existence of the directory is confirmed before proceeding.
+3.  **Execution (Extreme Programming):** The core logic, developed via **Test-Driven Development** and **Pair Programming**, recursively scans the directory for all recognized source files (`.nix`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.). The design is kept as **Simple** as possible.
+4.  **Processing (GMP):** Each file is treated as a batch. The `rnix-parser` component **(C4)** processes the raw material (source text) into a finished good (AST). Each parsing operation is logged with full **Traceability**.
+5.  **Output:** The command outputs a unified AST (in `sexpr` format) to `stdout`. This is the specified, validated output for this process.
+6.  **Deviation Handling (ISO 9001):** Any file that fails to parse is a **Non-conformance**. The SOP dictates that the file path and parsing error are logged as an **Incident (ITIL)**, and a **Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA)** is initiated to fix the source file or improve the parser.
+
+---
+
+## 2.0 Change & Quality Request (CRQ): Project Inception
+
+### 2.1 Change Description (ITIL)
+This CRQ authorizes the initiation of the Nix-Introspector project. This is a strategic change to introduce a new **Service** for managing Nix/Guix development, moving from a manual to an automated, introspective process.
+
+### 2.2 Business Case (Agile)
+We are building the Nix-Introspector to reduce the time and complexity of managing Nix configurations. This will increase developer **Velocity** and reduce errors. We will start with a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** consisting of the `observe` command and iterate based on **Customer Feedback**.
+
+### 2.3 DMAIC Framework (Six Sigma)
+*   **Define:** The problem is that managing Nix code is complex and error-prone. The **Customer** is the Nix/Guix developer.
+*   **Measure:** We will measure the current process via metrics like time-to-debug and number of configuration errors.
+*   **Analyze:** The root cause is a lack of introspection tools and the inherent complexity of the Nix language.
+*   **Improve:** We will improve the process by developing the `nix-introspector` tool.
+*   **Control:** We will control the improved process by integrating the tool into a CI pipeline, monitored by this quality plan.
+
+### 2.4 Architectural Approach (C4)
+The system will be designed as a single **Container** (a command-line application) named `nix-inspector`. This container will be composed of several **Components** (e.g., `NixParser`, `GuixTranslator`, `AstAggregator`). The architecture will be documented and reviewed iteratively.
+
+### 2.5 Quality & Compliance Statement (GMP/ISO 9001)
+This project will be developed in accordance with GMP principles for software development. All code will be version-controlled, all changes will be documented in a change log, and all releases will be **Validated** against a predefined set of user acceptance tests. This document serves as the top-level **Quality Manual** for the project.

+-   `linux-dev`: Standard development environment with Emacs.
+-   `linux-sci`: Full scientific environment with all packages.
 
-A simple, standalone shell is defined in `shell.nix`.
+Then, run the switch command (replace `linux-dev` with your chosen profile):
 
 ```bash
-nix-shell

 ```
+*Note: This assumes your local username is `user`. You may need to adjust `flake.nix` if your username is different.*
 
 ## Package Management
 
-Packages are added to the system in different locations depending on their purpose:
+Packages are managed by adding them to the appropriate module in the `home/` directory:
 
--   **Common Packages:** To make a package available to both `desktop` and `android` systems, add it to the `commonPackages` set within `flake.nix`.

+# SOP: Third-Party Tool Evaluation & Integration
+
+**Document ID:** PI-SOP-002, Rev 1.0
+**Applicable Standards:** ISO 9001, ITILv4, C4 Model, GMP, Six Sigma, Agile
+
+---
+
+## 1.0 Purpose (ISO 9001)
+
+To define a controlled, repeatable, and traceable process for searching, evaluating, and vendorizing third-party software components. This ensures new tools meet stringent quality requirements (**GMP**) before being integrated into the primary development environment, thus minimizing project risk and defects (**Six Sigma**).
+
+## 2.0 Scope
+
+This SOP applies to all new command-line tools and libraries being considered for use in the `nix-introspector` project. The procedure is initiated via the `evaluate` command.
+
+## 3.0 The `evaluate` Command
+
+The entire evaluation process is orchestrated by a new command added to our root `nix-introspector` tool.
+
+*   **User Story (Agile):** As a Developer, I want to evaluate a new tool from a git repository so that I can test its functionality in a safe, isolated environment and record the results for my team.
+*   **Invocation:** `cargo run -- evaluate <git-url-of-tool>`
+
+## 4.0 Procedure (ITIL/GMP)
+
+The `evaluate` command automates the following lifecycle, which represents a standard **Change (ITIL)** to the project's toolchain.
+
+### 4.1 Step 1: Initiation (Change Request)
+
+A Developer identifies a candidate tool (e.g., `github:nixos/statix`). The process is initiated by running:
+`cargo run -- evaluate github:nixos/statix`
+
+### 4.2 Step 2: Sandbox Provisioning (Nix)
+
+The command automates the creation of an isolated experimental environment.
+1.  A new directory is created: `experiments/<tool-name>/`.
+2.  A new `flake.nix` is generated inside this directory.
+3.  This flake defines a `devShell` that includes the tool being evaluated, using the provided URL as a flake input. This creates a perfect, ephemeral sandbox for the experiment, ensuring **Process Control (Six Sigma)**.
+
+### 4.3 Step 3: Vendorization (Traceability)
+
+For traceability and reference, the command adds the tool's repository as a git submodule under `vendor/external/<tool-name>`. This creates a permanent record of the exact version evaluated (**ISO 9001**).
+
+### 4.4 Step 4: Test Case Preparation (GMP)
+
+The command populates the experiment directory with a standardized set of test cases.
+1.  A `test_cases/` subdirectory is created.
+2.  Known "good" code samples are copied into it.
+3.  Known "bad" code samples (e.g., our currently broken `home/*.nix` files) are also copied. This constitutes the material for the **Validation** process.
+
+### 4.5 Step 5: Execution & Measurement (Six Sigma)
+
+The Developer enters the sandboxed shell to perform the evaluation.
+1.  `nix develop ./experiments/<tool-name>`
+2.  The tool is run against the test cases (e.g., `statix check ./test_cases/bad_code.nix`).
+3.  All output (stdout, stderr) and the exit code are captured. This is the **Measure** phase of DMAIC.
+
+### 4.6 Step 6: Structured Reporting (ISO 9001)
+
+The results must be documented in a structured report located at `experiments/<tool-name>/EVALUATION_REPORT.md`. The report must contain:
+*   **Control Information:** Tool Name, Version, Git URL, Evaluation Date.
+*   **Test Case:** A description of the test (e.g., "Linter check on file with known syntax error").
+*   **Specification:** The expected outcome (e.g., "Linter should exit with a non-zero status and report a syntax error").
+*   **Result:** The actual, captured outcome.
+*   **Analysis (CAPA):** A description of any **Non-conformance**. If the tool failed, a **Corrective Action** might be to reject the tool. If it succeeded, the **Preventive Action** is its adoption.
+*   **Decision:** A formal recommendation (Approve/Reject) for integrating the tool.
+
+### 4.7 Step 7: Closure (ITIL)
+Once the report is complete, the evaluation is considered finished, and the **Change Request** is closed. The experimental directory can be archived.

    docs: Overhaul README and normalize Nix configuration
    
    - Replaces the existing README with a comprehensive guide covering the project structure, usage instructions for NixOS and nix-on-droid, and package management guidelines.
    - Adds a standard `home.packages` section to the home-manager configuration to align with the new documentation.
    - Normalizes the flake inputs to ensure nix-on-droid uses the same nixpkgs version.
    - Cleans up the android.nix configuration.
    - Adds figlet to the legacy shell.nix.

+# My Nix Configurations
 
-This repository contains my NixOS and Nix-on-Droid configurations.
+This repository contains my personal Nix configurations for my desktop (NixOS) and Android (`nix-on-droid`) environments. The entire setup is managed centrally via a single `flake.nix`.
 
-**NixOS Configuration**
-The NixOS configuration is now located in the `configurations/desktop.nix` file.
+## Repository Structure
 
-**Nix-on-Droid Configuration**
-The Nix-on-Droid configuration is now located in the `configurations/android.nix` file.
+The repository is organized to separate concerns between system-level configuration, user-level packages, and development shells.
 
----
+-   `flake.nix`: The heart of the configuration. It defines all inputs (like `nixpkgs` and `nix-on-droid`), manages overlays, and exposes the final system configurations and packages.
+-   `shell.nix`: A standalone, non-flake development shell for quick tasks. Note: This provides an environment separate from the main flake configurations.
+-   `configurations/`: Contains the top-level configurations for each target system.
+    -   `desktop.nix`: The main module for the NixOS desktop system.
+    -   `android.nix`: The main module for the `nix-on-droid` mobile environment.
+-   `.config/home-manager/`: Contains user-level configuration that can be shared across systems, managed by Home Manager.
+-   `.config/nix/`: Contains a detailed, standalone Nix-based configuration for Emacs.
 
-## 🚀 Nix-on-Droid for N00bs: A Multi-Part Tutorial 🚀
+## Usage
 
-Welcome, aspiring Nix-on-Droid wizard! This tutorial will guide you through the basics of using Nix to manage your Android environment. Get ready for a journey into reproducible and powerful mobile configurations!
+### Building Systems
 
-### How to Render PlantUML Diagrams
+To apply a system configuration, run the appropriate command from the root of this repository:
 
-Throughout this tutorial, you'll find code blocks marked with `plantuml`. To view these diagrams, you'll need a PlantUML renderer. You can use:
+**NixOS (Desktop):**
 
-*   **Online Renderer:** Copy the PlantUML code into an online renderer like [PlantUML Online Server](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml).
-*   **Local Setup:** Install PlantUML (e.g., `nix-env -iA nixpkgs.plantuml`) and use the `plantuml` command-line tool to generate images.
-
-### Part 2: Your First Nix-on-Droid Configuration
-
-Ready to get your hands dirty? Let's install your first package using Nix-on-Droid!
-
-Your Nix-on-Droid configuration lives in a special file: `~/.config/nix-on-droid/nix-on-droid.nix`. This is where you declare all the packages and settings you want for your mobile environment.
-
-1.  **Open your configuration file:**
-
-    ```bash
-    # You can use 'vim', 'nano', or any editor you prefer
-    vim ~/.config/nix-on-droid/nix-on-droid.nix
-    ```
-
-2.  **Find the `environment.packages` section:**
-
-    You'll see a section that looks something like this:
-
-    ```nix
-      environment.packages = with pkgs; [
-        # User-facing stuff that you really really want to have
-        vim
-        git
-        gemini-cli
-        emacs
-        # ... other packages ...
-      ];
-    ```
-
-3.  **Add a new package:**
-
-    Let's add the `hello` package, a classic first program that simply prints "Hello, world!". Add `hello` to the list, making sure to keep the correct Nix syntax (commas between items, and within the `[` and `]` brackets).
-
-    ```nix
-      environment.packages = with pkgs; [
-        # User-facing stuff that you really really want to have
-        vim
-        git
-        gemini-cli
-        emacs
-        hello # <-- Add this line!
-        # ... other packages ...
-      ];
-    ```
-
-4.  **Apply your changes:**
-
-    Save the file and exit your editor. Now, it's time to tell Nix-on-Droid to apply your new configuration. This is done with the `switch` command:
-
-    ```bash
-    nix-on-droid switch --flake ~/.config/nix-on-droid
-    ```
-
-    Nix will now download (if necessary) and build the `hello` package, and then activate it in your environment. You'll see a lot of output as Nix works its magic. Once it's done, you should be able to run `hello`!
-
-    ```bash
-    hello
-    # Expected output: Hello, world!
-    ```
-
----
-
-#### 🗺️ The `switch` Command in Action
-
-This diagram illustrates what happens when you run `nix-on-droid switch`:
-
-```plantuml
-@startuml
-skinparam handwritten true
-skinparam monochrome true
-
-actor User
-rectangle "nix-on-droid.nix (Modified)" as Config
-rectangle "Nix Store (Builds)" as Store
-rectangle "Current Environment" as OldEnv
-rectangle "New Environment" as NewEnv
-
-User --> Config : Edits config
-Config --> Store : "nix-on-droid switch" triggers build
-Store --> NewEnv : New symlinks created
-OldEnv --> NewEnv : Atomically switches to new environment
-
-note right of Config
-  "I added 'hello'!"
-end note
-
-note right of Store
-  "Building 'hello' and
-  all its dependencies."
-end note
-
-note right of NewEnv
-  "'hello' is now available!"
-end note
-
-@enduml
+```bash
+sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#desktop
 ```

-#### 🖼️ Imagen Prompt: "Happy Package Installation"
-
-Imagine a vibrant, cartoon-style illustration. A friendly, anthropomorphic package (perhaps a small, smiling box with arms and legs) is joyfully leaping into a smartphone screen. The screen displays a simplified command line interface with the text "hello, world!". Bright, colorful lines and stars emanate from the package, symbolizing successful installation. The background is a soft, warm gradient, suggesting a feeling of accomplishment and ease. The overall mood is playful and triumphant.
-

-
-### Part 3: Understanding `environment.packages` and `pkgs`
-
-You've seen `environment.packages = with pkgs; [...]` a few times now. Let's break down what `with pkgs;` means and how to find more packages.
-
-*   **`environment.packages`**: This is a NixOS/Nix-on-Droid option that tells your system which packages you want to have available in your user environment. When you run `nix-on-droid switch`, Nix ensures these packages are built (if necessary) and symlinked into your profile.
-
-*   **`pkgs`**: This is a special variable that refers to the entire Nixpkgs collection – a massive repository of thousands of software packages. When you use `with pkgs;`, you're essentially saying, "I want to refer to packages directly by their names from the `pkgs` collection, without having to type `pkgs.` before each one."
-
-    For example, `with pkgs; [ vim git ]` is equivalent to `[ pkgs.vim pkgs.git ]`. The `with pkgs;` just makes it more concise and readable.
-
-#### How to Find More Packages
-
-Nixpkgs is vast! How do you find the package you're looking for? The easiest way is to use the `nix-env -qaP` command, which queries the available packages.
+**Nix-on-Droid (Android):**
 
 ```bash
-nix-env -qaP <search-term>
-# Example: Search for Python
-nix-env -qaP python
-
-# Example: Search for a specific Python package (e.g., numpy)
-nix-env -qaP python3Packages.numpy
+nix-on-droid switch --flake .#android
 ```
 
-This command will list all packages whose names or descriptions match your search term, along with their full attribute path (e.g., `nixpkgs.python3Packages.numpy`). You can then use this attribute path in your `nix-on-droid.nix` file.
-
----
-
-#### 🎶 Song: The Nixpkgs Explorer's Anthem 🎶
-
-(Verse 1)
-In the land of Nix, where packages reside,
-A treasure trove, with nothing left to hide.
-From `vim` to `zsh`, a world so grand,
-All at your fingertips, across the land.
-
-(Chorus)
-Oh, Nixpkgs, our guide, our shining star,
-With `nix-env -qaP`, we search near and far.
-For every tool, a path so clear,
-No more dependency woes, no more fear!
-
-(Verse 2)
-`with pkgs;` a magic phrase, you see,
-Unlocking power, for you and me.
-No need for `pkgs.` before each name,
-Just pure functional bliss, in this coding game.
-
-(Chorus)
-Oh, Nixpkgs, our guide, our shining star,
-With `nix-env -qaP`, we search near and far.
-For every tool, a path so clear,
-No more dependency woes, no more fear!
+### Development Shells
 
----
+There are two provided shell environments:
 
-### Part 4: Beyond Basic Packages (Optional/Advanced)
+**1. Flake Development Shell (Recommended)**
 
-As you become more comfortable with Nix-on-Droid, you might want to explore more advanced topics. These are just a few pointers to guide your future learning:
+The flake exposes a development shell that includes the common packages. This is the most consistent way to enter a development environment that matches the project's settings.
 
-*   **Overlays:** Customize existing packages or add new ones that aren't in the main Nixpkgs repository.
-*   **Modules:** For more complex configurations, NixOS and Home Manager use a modular system. You can define services, user settings, and more in a structured way.
-*   **Flakes:** A newer, experimental feature that aims to make Nix projects more reproducible and easier to share.
-
-These topics can significantly extend the power and flexibility of your Nix-on-Droid environment. Don't feel pressured to dive into them immediately, but know they're there when you're ready!

-#### 🎬 Video Prompt: "Nix-on-Droid Power User Montage"
-
-Imagine a fast-paced, energetic video montage. Start with quick cuts of a user's fingers flying across a mobile keyboard, showing various Termux commands and Nix-on-Droid configurations being applied. Transition to scenes of complex development environments running smoothly on a phone (e.g., a web server, a Python script, a game engine). Include visual effects like glowing lines connecting different parts of the system, symbolizing seamless integration. The video should convey a sense of empowerment, efficiency, and the unexpected capability of mobile devices with Nix-on-Droid. Upbeat, driving electronic music plays in the background. The final shot is the user smiling confidently at their phone, with a subtle "Powered by Nix" logo appearing.

-## 🏗️ Rework: Supporting Desktop and Android
-
-This repository is now structured to support both desktop NixOS environments and Android (Termux) environments using Nix. The core idea is to centralize common configurations and provide platform-specific entry points through a top-level `flake.nix`.
-
-### New Configuration Structure
-
-*   **`flake.nix`**: The new top-level flake file that defines and orchestrates both desktop and Android configurations.
-*   **`configurations/`**: This directory houses platform-specific Nix configurations.
-    *   **`configurations/desktop.nix`**: Contains packages and configurations primarily for desktop NixOS environments.
-    *   **`configurations/android.nix`**: Contains packages and configurations specifically for Android (Termux) environments using Nix-on-Droid.
-*   **`shell.nix`**: (In root) Remains a generic development shell that can be used on both platforms.
-
-### How to Apply Configurations
-
-*   **For Desktop (NixOS):**
-
-    To apply your desktop configuration, navigate to the root of this repository and use:
-
-    ```bash
-    sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#desktop
-    ```
-
-*   **For Android (Nix-on-Droid):**
-
-    To apply your Android configuration, navigate to the root of this repository and use:
-
-    ```bash
-    nix-on-droid switch --flake .#android
-    ```
-
-This new structure allows for clearer separation and management of your Nix configurations across different devices.

-### Part 1: What is Nix? Why Nix-on-Droid?
-
-Imagine your software environment as a meticulously crafted recipe. With traditional package managers, you often get a mix of ingredients from various sources, sometimes leading to unexpected flavors or even spoiled dishes. Nix, on the other hand, is like a master chef who ensures every ingredient is precisely measured, sourced, and prepared, guaranteeing the exact same delicious outcome every single time.
-
-Nix is a *purely functional* package manager. This means:
-*   **Reproducibility:** If it builds on one Nix system, it builds identically on another. No "it works on my machine" excuses!
-*   **Atomic Upgrades & Rollbacks:** Updates either succeed completely or don't happen at all. If something breaks, you can instantly revert to a previous working state.
-*   **Multiple Versions:** You can have different versions of the same software installed side-by-side without conflicts.
-
-**Why Nix-on-Droid?**
-
-Now, bring that power to your Android device! Nix-on-Droid leverages Nix to manage your Termux environment. This is revolutionary for mobile development and system management:
-*   **Consistent Dev Environment:** Set up your exact development tools on your phone, just like on your desktop.
-*   **Isolation:** Experiment with new tools without polluting your base system.
-*   **Easy Sharing:** Share your entire mobile development setup with others, knowing it will work for them.

-#### 🌿 The Nix Philosophy: A Declarative Flow
-
-Here's a simple visual of how Nix approaches your system configuration:
-
-```plantuml
-@startuml
-skinparam handwritten true
-skinparam monochrome true
-
-actor User
-rectangle "Nix Configuration (e.g., nix-on-droid.nix)" as Config
-rectangle "Nix Store" as Store
-rectangle "Your Environment" as Env
-
-User --> Config : Defines desired state
-Config --> Store : Builds derivations (packages, configs)
-Store --> Env : Symlinks to create environment
-
-note right of Config
-  "I want these packages,
-  configured this way."
-end note
-
-note right of Store
-  "Here are the
-  isolated, reproducible
-  builds."
-end note
-
-note right of Env
-  "My system now
-  matches the config."
-end note
-
-@enduml
+```bash
+nix develop
 ```

+**2. Legacy Shell**
 
-#### 📜 A Nix Poem
+A simple, standalone shell is defined in `shell.nix`.
 
-In realms of code, where chaos often reigns,
-A new philosophy, pure and free from stains.
-With Nix, a promise, clear and bold,
-Your digital garden, stories to unfold.
-
-No more "it works on my machine," a whispered plea,
-For every build, a perfect, mirrored tree.
-From tiny phone to server grand,
-A symphony of software, hand in hand.
-
-So embrace the flakes, the derivations deep,
-While your mobile dreams, securely sleep.
-Nix-on-Droid, a beacon, shining bright,
-For every n00b, a guiding light.

+## Package Management
 
+Packages are added to the system in different locations depending on their purpose:
 
+-   **Common Packages:** To make a package available to both `desktop` and `android` systems, add it to the `commonPackages` set within `flake.nix`.
+-   **Desktop-only System Packages:** Add the package to `environment.systemPackages` in `configurations/desktop.nix`.
+-   **Android-only System Packages:** Add the package to `environment.packages` in `configurations/android.nix`.
+-   **User-specific Packages:** User-level packages should be added to the `home.packages` list in `.config/home-manager/home.nix`.
