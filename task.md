# Project Rundown

This project is focused on setting up a development environment using Nix, specifically for Android (nix-on-droid) and other Linux systems. We are using Nix flakes for configuration management.

## Current Activities:
-   Implementing and refining the Meme Identification and Documentation SOP.
-   Generating and documenting executable memes in Rust.
-   Creating a comprehensive table of meme correspondences.
-   Generating reflection memes for all existing memes.

## Next Steps:
-   Continue extraction and transformation of JSON tickets from the `quasi-meta-meme` repository into new Markdown memes, to be located in `docs/memes/extracted_tickets/`.
-   Further refining the SOPs based on ongoing observations and challenges.
-   Continuously identifying and documenting new memes from various project sources.

## Project Information

### Log Locations

Asciinema recordings of development sessions are stored in:
`${HOME}/logs/gemini/`

Each session will have a unique filename based on the timestamp (e.g., `session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.cast`).
