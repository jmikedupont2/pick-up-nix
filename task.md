# Project Rundown

This project is focused on setting up a development environment using Nix, specifically for Android (nix-on-droid) and other Linux systems. We are using Nix flakes for configuration management.

## Current Activities:
-   Implementing and refining the Meme Identification and Documentation SOP.

## Next Steps:
-   Continue identifying and documenting memes from various project sources, including `data/md.txt` and other relevant files, following the established SOP.
-   Review and refine the newly created SOP (`docs/sops/meme_identification_sop.md`) and the extracted memes glossary (`docs/memes/extracted_memes_glossary.md`).

## Project Information

### Log Locations

Asciinema recordings of development sessions are stored in:
`${HOME}/logs/gemini/`

Each session will have a unique filename based on the timestamp (e.g., `session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.cast`).
