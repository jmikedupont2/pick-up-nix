# Project Intent: Formal Verification of WASM-based Rust Replacement for ElizaOS Plugins

## Overarching Goal

The primary objective is to replace the existing TypeScript (TS) functionality of ElizaOS plugins with WebAssembly (WASM)-compiled Rust code. This replacement aims for binary compatibility, ensuring seamless integration and equivalent behavior.

## Formal Verification with Lean 4

A critical aspect of this project is the formal verification of the Rust replacement code using the Lean 4 theorem prover. The goal is to rigorously prove the correctness and type compatibility of the Rust implementation against the original TypeScript functionality.

## 42-Step Verification Process

The formal verification process will be executed in a structured, 42-step approach, encompassing the following key phases:

1.  **Rust Code Development:** Write the Rust code that implements the desired functionality, intended to replace the TypeScript components.
2.  **TypeScript Introspection (Rust Parser):** Utilize a Rust-based parser to introspect and analyze the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and type information of the original TypeScript code.
3.  **Rust to Lean Conversion:** Develop a mechanism or tool to convert the Rust code (or its relevant properties) into a representation understandable by Lean 4.
4.  **TypeScript to Lean Conversion:** Develop a mechanism or tool to convert the TypeScript code (or its relevant properties) into a representation understandable by Lean 4.
5.  **Type Compatibility Proofs in Lean 4:** For each function in the original TypeScript codebase, identify a corresponding function in the Rust replacement. Formally prove within Lean 4 that these Rust functions are type-compatible with their TypeScript counterparts, ensuring the correctness of the replacement.

This ambitious process aims to achieve a high degree of confidence in the correctness and equivalence of the Rust-based WASM modules.
