# CRQ-004: Implement Shell Script Linting and Automated Testing

## 1. Problem Description

Currently, there is no systematic process for enforcing shell scripting best practices or for automatically verifying script correctness. This leads to:

*   Inconsistent code style and quality.
*   Undetected syntax errors, logical flaws, and security vulnerabilities.
*   Increased manual effort for code reviews and debugging.
*   Lack of confidence in script reliability.

## 2. Proposed Solution

Implement automated linting and testing for all shell scripts within the project.

### 2.1. Shell Script Linting

Integrate a shell script linter (e.g., `shellcheck`) into the development workflow.

*   **Pre-commit Hook:** Configure `shellcheck` as a pre-commit hook to catch issues before code is committed.
*   **CI/CD Integration:** Include `shellcheck` in the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline to ensure all pushed code adheres to standards.

### 2.2. Automated Testing

Develop and implement automated tests for shell scripts.

*   **Unit Tests:** For individual script functions or small, isolated logic blocks.
*   **Integration Tests:** For scripts that interact with each other or external systems (e.g., `build_and_report.sh` should have tests that run the QA scripts and verify their output).
*   **Remote Script Testing:** For remote management scripts, consider using a testing framework that can simulate remote environments or run tests against ephemeral test instances (e.g., Docker containers, virtual machines).

## 3. Scope

This CRQ applies to all shell scripts within the project, including:

*   All scripts identified in `script_review_findings.md`.
*   Any new shell scripts developed in the future.

## 4. Expected Outcome

*   Improved code quality and consistency across all shell scripts.
*   Early detection of errors and vulnerabilities.
*   Reduced debugging time and increased developer productivity.
*   Increased confidence in the reliability and correctness of shell scripts.
*   Automated enforcement of shell scripting best practices.

## 5. Priority

**High** - This is crucial for maintaining code quality, preventing regressions, and enabling efficient development.

## 6. Dependencies

*   Installation and configuration of `shellcheck`.
*   Selection and implementation of a shell script testing framework (if applicable).
*   Integration with existing CI/CD pipeline.

## 7. Metrics for Success

*   All shell scripts pass `shellcheck` with zero warnings/errors.
*   Test coverage for critical shell scripts (to be defined).
*   Successful execution of automated tests in the CI/CD pipeline.
