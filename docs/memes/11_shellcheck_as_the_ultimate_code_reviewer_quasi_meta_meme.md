## 11. "Shellcheck as the Ultimate Code Reviewer" (Quasi-Meta-Meme)
*   **Source:** Our recent interactions with `shellcheck` errors during commits.
*   **Concept:** The strictness and unforgiving nature of `shellcheck` in enforcing shell scripting best practices, almost as if it's a sentient, unyielding code quality guardian. It's a humorous nod to the pain and eventual satisfaction of passing linting checks.
*   **Meme Idea:** A stern `shellcheck` mascot with a red pen, marking up a messy script, or a developer celebrating wildly after a `shellcheck` run passes.
