*   **Source:** `ARCHITECTURAL_VISION.md` - "The Digital Asset ('Smart Contract')" section
*   **Concept:** The strong conceptual leap of equating a standard Git submodule to an "instance of a 'smart contract'." It's a humorous exaggeration of how traditional software components can be re-imagined through a blockchain lens.
*   **Meme Idea:** A Git logo wearing a top hat and monocle, or a diagram showing a simple `git clone` command leading to a complex blockchain transaction.
