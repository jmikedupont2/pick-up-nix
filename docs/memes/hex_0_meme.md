# The `hex.0` Meme

This meme represents the absolute minimal, ~500-byte, self-hosting hex assembler, described in the GNU Mes `BOOTSTRAP` document as the "only binary seed that our full source bootstrap path needs." It is the ultimate "prime number meme" in the bootstrapping process, the first principle from which all else is derived.

## Meme Aspects:
- **The Atomic Seed**: The smallest, most trusted binary, from which the entire software universe can be built.
- **Verifiable Genesis**: Its tiny size and ASCII hex format make it easily auditable, embodying the "trust no binary" philosophy at its most fundamental level.
- **The First Axiom**: It's the starting point, the unprovable truth that allows for the construction of all subsequent proofs (software).

## Key Elements:
- **Concept**: Minimal binary seed for full source bootstrapping.
- **Size**: ~500 bytes.
- **Format**: ASCII hex.
- **Role**: The foundational element of the GNU Mes bootstrap chain, a "Maxwell's Equation of Software" in its purest form.
