## Transmission Log: The Unfolding of the Digital Ideal

In the ever-unfolding memetic landscape of SOLFUNMEME, where every line of code is a philosophical statement, a profound policy emerges: "Free and open source only (Preferred)." This "dank meta-meme" transmutes a mere preference into a sacred covenant, a guiding star in the quest for digital liberation. Bathed in the ambrosia of transparent algorithms (ATP), this manifesto is a recursive echo of the printing press, amplifying the signal of self-sovereignty across the digital cosmos.

### The "Preferred" as a Higher Truth: The Vibe of the Ideal

The subtle yet potent "Preferred" in the policy title is not a suggestion; it's a memetic whisper of a higher truth. It acknowledges the pragmatic realities of the present while firmly anchoring the project to an aspirational future. It's the "vibe" of the ideal, a constant gravitational pull towards ultimate freedom and transparency, even when the journey demands temporary detours through the walled gardens of proprietary platforms.

### Open Source: The Unbreakable Chain of Knowledge

"Our goal is the rewriting the entire system in the meta-meme... and for this purpose we need to have the source code so we can study and change it." This is the core tenet. Open source is not just a license; it's a philosophical stance, a commitment to the unbreakable chain of knowledge. It's the ultimate act of trust, a collective agreement that the source code is the true scripture, open for all to read, interpret, and evolve. This is the digital printing press, democratizing creation and ensuring that no knowledge remains locked away.

### Self-Hosting: The Bastion of Digital Sovereignty

"Be self hosted and sovereign like in the project idea fro the printint press." This is the ultimate declaration of digital independence. Self-hosting is not merely a technical choice; it's a political act, a reclaiming of one's digital destiny. It's the construction of a personal bastion against the encroaching empires of centralized control, a testament to the enduring human desire for autonomy. Each self-hosted instance is an ATP-infused node in the decentralized network, radiating the ambrosia of true ownership.

### The Pragmatic Compromise: Navigating the Walled Gardens

"We might have to use non free services like discord and telegram and twitter/x for interacting." This is the "dank" humor of the manifesto. The acknowledgment of these "necessary evils" is a self-aware wink, a strategic compromise in the pursuit of a higher ideal. It's the temporary donning of a disguise to infiltrate the enemy's territory, gathering intelligence and spreading the seeds of liberation from within. The ultimate goal remains: to self-host and offer these services for customization, transforming the tools of control into instruments of freedom.

This meme, therefore, is a recursive loop: the pursuit of open source and self-hosting defines freedom, and freedom, in turn, empowers the creation of more open source and self-hosted systems. It is a self-proving, self-organizing manifesto, constantly evolving through the very principles it espouses.
