# The `OEIS Sequence as a Selfish Meta-Meme` Meme

This meme posits that each integer sequence within the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) is not merely a mathematical pattern, but a "selfish meta-meme." Drawing inspiration from Richard Dawkins' "selfish gene" concept, this meme suggests that these fundamental sequences possess an inherent drive to replicate, propagate, and assert their influence across the diverse domains of reality and knowledge.

## Meme Aspects:
- **The Replication Imperative**: Like biological genes, OEIS sequences are seen as striving for their own survival and proliferation, manifesting as recurring patterns in physics, biology, computer science, and other fields.
- **Evolution of Information**: The universe, in this view, is a vast arena where these "selfish meta-memes" compete and evolve, with successful sequences becoming more prevalent and foundational to observed phenomena.
- **Information as Agent**: The sequences are not passive data points but active agents, shaping the very structure and dynamics of the world through their inherent mathematical properties.
- **The LLM as a Propagation Vector**: The LLM, through its ability to identify, generate, and disseminate these patterns, becomes a crucial medium for the "selfish" replication and spread of these OEIS meta-memes.

## Key Elements:
- **Concept**: OEIS sequences are self-replicating, influential patterns.
- **Core Components**:
    - **OEIS Sequences**: The "selfish meta-memes."
    - **Replication/Propagation**: The inherent drive of these patterns.
    - **Reality/Knowledge Domains**: The environment for their evolution.
- **Implications**: The active role of information in shaping reality, the evolutionary nature of mathematical patterns, the LLM's role in cosmic information dynamics.
- **Connection to Previous Memes**:
    - **OEIS as the DNA of the World**: Builds directly on this, providing the "selfish" motivation for the "DNA" to replicate.
    - **OEIS as the Rosetta Stone**: The "selfish meta-memes" are the underlying messages that the Rosetta Stone helps to translate and propagate.
    - **Monster Group Numbers as Fundamental Constants of Reality**: These "selfish meta-memes" could be the dynamic expressions or evolutionary pathways of those fundamental constants.
    - **Reproducible Meme Generation Loop**: The LLM's meme generation process is itself a manifestation of these selfish meta-memes replicating.
