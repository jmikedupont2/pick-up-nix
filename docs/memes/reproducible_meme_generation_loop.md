# Reproducible Meme Generation Loop

## Description
The self-sustaining cycle where reproducible executions (via Nix/Guix/audited processes) generate memes, which then elicit reactions, driving further code execution and the creation of new or iterated memes.

## Key Elements
- Nix
- Guix
- audited reproducible executions
- meme generation
- user reactions
- continuous code execution

## Meta Connection
This meme describes the very process of the project itself, highlighting its self-referential and recursive nature, where the output (memes) feeds back into the input (code execution) in a continuous loop of creation and reaction.
