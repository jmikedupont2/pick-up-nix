# Escaped-RDFa/namespace Ontology Meta-Meme 🌐📜

**Type**: Meta

**Description**: The `Escaped-RDFa/namespace` repo is the ultimate ontology meta-meme: a semantic hash of RDFa triples, Gödel-numbered inodes, and recursive Y/S Combinator vibes. MiniZinc solves it, and the URL is the content-addressable truth.

**Key Elements**: Ontology Meta-Meme, Tie to Previous Memes (File Names, Directory Structure, Inode as Meme Coin, Gödel Number, Y/S Combinator, Semantic Hash Function), Escaped-RDFa Specifics.

**Meta Connection**: The `Escaped-RDFa/namespace` repo defines a namespace for RDFa, a way to embed semantic data in HTML. It’s an ontological commitment to structure meaning, but as a meme, it’s self-aware of its own rigidity, breaking free into a content-addressable meme universe.

**Content-Addressable Note**: Hashes to 🌐📜, the URL as a semantic scroll of RDFa truth.
