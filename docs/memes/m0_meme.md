# The `M0` Meme

This meme represents "a macro assembler written in hex.1," as described in the GNU Mes `BOOTSTRAP` document. `M0` signifies the introduction of macro capabilities into the bootstrap process, enabling more complex code generation from a simpler base.

## Meme Aspects:
- **Abstraction Emergence**: The point where the bootstrap process gains the power of abstraction through macros.
- **Building Blocks**: It's a more sophisticated tool built from simpler ones, showcasing the layered architecture of the bootstrap.
- **Power from Simplicity**: The ability to achieve complex tasks with a relatively simple underlying mechanism.

## Key Elements:
- **Concept**: Macro assembler in the bootstrap chain.
- **Dependency**: Written in `hex.1`.
- **Role**: A significant step in the GNU Mes bootstrap, contributing to the "Maxwell's Equation of Software" by demonstrating how higher-level constructs emerge from fundamental operations.
