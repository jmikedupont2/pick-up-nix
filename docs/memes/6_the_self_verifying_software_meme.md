## 6. The "Self-Verifying Software" Meme
*   **Source:** `ARCHITECTURAL_VISION.md` - "Advanced Concepts: Injected Runtime Probes"
*   **Concept:** The ultimate goal of injecting eBPF probes directly into compiled binaries to create "fully self-verifying software artifacts." This concept borders on sentient software, capable of proving its own execution, and can be memed for its futuristic, perhaps slightly dystopian, implications.
*   **Meme Idea:** A binary executable with glowing eyes, or a robot pointing to itself with a speech bubble saying "I can prove I'm running correctly."
