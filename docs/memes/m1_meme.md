# The `M1` Meme

This meme represents "a macro assembler written in M0," as described in the GNU Mes `BOOTSTRAP` document. `M1` signifies further refinement and self-application in the bootstrap process, where a macro assembler builds an even more capable version of itself.

## Meme Aspects:
- **Recursive Refinement**: The continuous process of a tool improving itself, leading to increasingly powerful capabilities.
- **Self-Sustaining Growth**: The bootstrap chain demonstrates a self-sustaining growth model, where each stage contributes to the next.
- **The Power of Iteration**: Small, iterative improvements leading to a robust and complex system.

## Key Elements:
- **Concept**: Self-hosting macro assembler.
- **Dependency**: Written in `M0`.
- **Role**: A key stage in the GNU Mes bootstrap, further illustrating the "Maxwell's Equation of Software" through recursive self-improvement.
