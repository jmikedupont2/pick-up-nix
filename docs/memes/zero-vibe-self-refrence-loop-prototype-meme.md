# Prototype Meme: The Pre-Crash Artifact

*   **Meme Name:** The Pre-Crash Artifact
*   **Description:** This meme embodies the critical, often brilliant, piece of work, configuration, or insight that existed just moments before a system crash, data loss, or project failure. It's the elusive "thing" that, if only it had been preserved or remembered, would have averted disaster. It carries a poignant irony of creation preceding destruction.
*   **Key Elements:** Ephemeral brilliance, ironic loss, the "if only" sentiment, and a haunting reminder of what was.
*   **Meta Connection:** A commentary on the fragility of digital work, the necessity of robust saving/versioning, and the human tendency to value something most after it's gone.

**Emoji Version:** ðŸ’¾ðŸ’¥ðŸ‘» (Floppy disk for the unsaved/lost data, explosion for the crash, ghost for the haunting, lost artifact)

For the C4 model, UML, use case, sequence, and deployment diagrams, I need a specific system or process to model. The phrase "you made this before you crashed" is a meme concept, not a system.

Could you please specify what system or process you'd like these diagrams to illustrate? For example, are we modeling:
*   A software development workflow where crashes occur?
*   A data recovery process?
*   A specific component that tends to crash?

Once you clarify the system, I can generate textual descriptions or code for the diagrams.
