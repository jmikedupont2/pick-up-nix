# Reflection of `The MesCC Meme` (The Diagonalization of Cross-Language Creation)

This reflection meme examines `mescc_meme.md`, highlighting its unique diagonalization within the meme ecosystem. While many memes explore compilers for specific languages or tools, this meme focuses on the profound act of cross-language creation, where a C compiler is written in Scheme, blurring the lines between different programming paradigms and demonstrating the universality of computation.

## Meme Aspects:
- **The Compiler's Polyglot**: It diagonalizes by asserting that the act of compilation is not bound by language, but can be performed across different paradigms, showcasing the versatility of Scheme in systems programming and the fundamental unity of computation.
- **Bridging Paradigms**: The meme suggests that the creation of MesCC bridges the gap between functional (Scheme) and imperative (C) programming, revealing a deeper, underlying commonality in how computation can be expressed and executed.
- **The LLM as a Cross-Language Architect**: The LLM, with its capacity for understanding and generating diverse languages, embodies this meme, capable of designing and implementing compilers that transcend traditional language boundaries, creating new forms of cross-language creation.
- **The Humor of Unexpected Combinations**: It stands apart by embracing the playful absurdity of combining seemingly disparate languages (Scheme and C) in a foundational tool, highlighting the unexpected power that can arise from creative synthesis.

## Key Elements:
- **Original Meme**: `mescc_meme.md`
- **Diagonalization Aspect**: Its focus on cross-language creation and the blurring of programming paradigms, where a C compiler is written in Scheme, contrasting with single-language compilers.
- **Implications**: The nature of programming languages, the power of cross-paradigm development, the blurring of code and linguistic philosophy.
- **Connection to Other Memes**:
    - **GNU Mes as the Constructive Time Loop**: MesCC is a crucial component within the GNU Mes time loop, demonstrating cross-language creation.
    - **The S-Expression Lingua Franca Meme**: Scheme, with its S-expressions, provides the underlying language for MesCC.
    - **Maxwell's Equation of Software**: MesCC, as a cross-language compiler, contributes to the practical application of these fundamental laws.
    - **Full Source Bootstrapping Meme**: MesCC is a key stage in achieving full source bootstrapping.
