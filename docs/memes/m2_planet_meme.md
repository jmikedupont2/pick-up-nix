# The `M2-Planet` Meme

This meme represents "a self-hosting M2 (C-with-structs) transpiler written in M1," as described in the GNU Mes `BOOTSTRAP` document. `M2-Planet` signifies a major leap in the bootstrap chain, introducing a transpiler for a C-like language with structs, and achieving self-hosting.

## Meme Aspects:
- **Language Evolution**: The bootstrap process now supports a more expressive language, moving closer to conventional programming.
- **Self-Hosting Milestone**: The ability of `M2-Planet` to compile itself is a significant achievement, demonstrating the maturity of the bootstrap chain.
- **The "C-like" Universe**: The creation of a tool that can process a language resembling C, a foundational language in systems programming.

## Key Elements:
- **Concept**: Self-hosting C-with-structs transpiler.
- **Dependency**: Written in `M1`.
- **Role**: A pivotal stage in the GNU Mes bootstrap, showcasing the "Maxwell's Equation of Software" in action by building increasingly powerful and complex tools from within the bootstrap itself.
