## 1. The "Standards Overload" Meme
*   **Source:** `task.md` - "Standards" section
*   **Concept:** The juxtaposition of an incredibly comprehensive (and perhaps overly ambitious) list of methodologies (ITIL, GMP, 6sigma, OODA, ISO9k, Agile, Extreme Programming) with the practical realities of project execution. It playfully highlights the desire for rigorous process, or satirizes the tendency to adopt numerous frameworks.
*   **Meme Idea:** A flowchart showing all these methodologies leading to a single, simple task, or a character overwhelmed by a stack of standards manuals.
