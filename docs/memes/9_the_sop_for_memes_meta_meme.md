*   **Source:** Project's extensive use of SOPs (`docs/sops/`).
*   **Concept:** A satirical take on the project's rigorous adherence to Standard Operating Procedures, applying the concept to something as inherently unstructured as meme generation. It's a meta-commentary on process-driven environments.
*   **Meme Idea:** A formal, multi-step flowchart for "Meme Creation and Approval Process," or a stern-looking manager reviewing a meme with a checklist.
