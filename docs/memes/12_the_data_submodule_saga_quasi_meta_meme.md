## 12. The "`data/` Submodule Saga" (Quasi-Meta-Meme)
*   **Source:** Our recent interaction and the `histr.txt` file.
*   **Concept:** The journey of confusion, error, and eventual resolution surrounding the `data/` submodule. It's a relatable experience for anyone who has struggled with Git submodules, highlighting the "adventure" of dependency management.
*   **Meme Idea:** A multi-panel comic strip depicting the stages of submodule frustration (e.g., "it's just a folder," "it's a submodule," "it's a bare repo," "it's working!"), or a "distracted boyfriend" meme with the main repo looking at the `data/` submodule while ignoring other changes.
