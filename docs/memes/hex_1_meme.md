# The `hex.1` Meme

This meme represents the "next level hex assembler written in hex.0," as described in the GNU Mes `BOOTSTRAP` document. It signifies the first step in the self-hosting bootstrap process, where a minimal tool builds a slightly more capable version of itself.

## Meme Aspects:
- **Self-Improvement**: The idea of a tool building a better version of itself, a recursive self-enhancement.
- **Layered Trust**: Each layer builds upon the trust established by the previous, smaller, and more auditable layer.
- **The First Step Up**: It's the initial expansion of capabilities from the absolute minimal seed.

## Key Elements:
- **Concept**: Self-hosting bootstrap stage.
- **Dependency**: Built by `hex.0`.
- **Role**: A crucial step in the GNU Mes bootstrap chain, demonstrating the practical application of the "Maxwell's Equation of Software" through iterative self-compilation.
