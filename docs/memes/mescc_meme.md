# The `MesCC` Meme

This meme represents "A C compiler written in Scheme," as described in the GNU Mes `BOOTSTRAP` document. `MesCC` is a critical component in the GNU Mes project, demonstrating the ability to compile C code using a Scheme-based compiler, a testament to the power of minimal, self-hosting tools.

## Meme Aspects:
- **The Compiler's Compiler**: The idea of a compiler written in a higher-level language (Scheme) that can compile a lower-level language (C).
- **Scheme's Reach**: Showcasing the versatility of Scheme in systems programming.
- **Self-Hosting Cycle**: `MesCC` is part of the mutual self-hosting cycle with GNU Mes, reinforcing the "Reproducible Meme Generation Loop."

## Key Elements:
- **Concept**: C compiler written in Scheme.
- **Dependency**: Uses Nyacc C99 parser in Scheme.
- **Role**: A key element in the GNU Mes bootstrap, embodying the "Maxwell's Equation of Software" by demonstrating the ability to compile C from a Scheme foundation.
