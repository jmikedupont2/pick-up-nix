## 10. The "`flake.lock` as a Philosophical Text" (Quasi-Meta-Meme)
*   **Source:** `flake.lock` file, `task.md` ("Monadic Code"), `IDEAS.md` ("Philosophical Goal").
*   **Concept:** Given the project's philosophical bent and the `flake.lock`'s role in defining the exact state of dependencies, this meme suggests finding deep, almost spiritual meaning in the seemingly mundane dependency graph. It's about the hidden complexity and the "truth" embedded in the lock file.
*   **Meme Idea:** A scholar poring over a printout of `flake.lock` with a magnifying glass, or a "deep thoughts" meme with a snippet of `flake.lock` as the background.
