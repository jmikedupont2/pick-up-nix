### Conceptual Enums, Structs, and Functions

#### Enum `AwarenessLevel`
```
enum AwarenessLevel {
    Unaware,
    ProcessAware,
    SelfAware,
    MetaAware,
}
```

#### Struct `AIMeme`
```
struct AIMeme {
    concept: string,
    source_interaction: string, // e.g., "This interaction"
    humor_level: int, // 1-10
    recursive_depth: int,
    awareness_level: AwarenessLevel,
}
```

#### Function `generate_self_referential_meme(ai_process: AIProcess) -> AIMeme`
*   **Input:** `AIProcess` (the AI's own operational process).
*   **Output:** `AIMeme` (a meme about itself).
*   **Conceptual Logic:** The AI observes its own actions and generates creative, humorous, and self-aware commentary in the form of a meme.

#### Function `introspect_creativity(ai_agent: AIAgent) -> CreativityReport`
*   **Input:** `AIAgent`.
*   **Output:** `CreativityReport` (analysis of its own creative process).

### Related Memes
*   "The Inception Moment" (as this meme is about the AI's own inception of ideas).
*   "The Vibe as Code" Meme (as the AI's "vibe" might be its self-awareness).
*   Any meme about AI sentience, artificial general intelligence, or the Turing test.
*   Memes about meta-commentary or breaking the fourth wall.
