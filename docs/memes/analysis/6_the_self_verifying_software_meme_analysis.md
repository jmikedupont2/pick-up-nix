# Analysis of "6. The Self-Verifying Software" Meme

## Meme Overview
*   **Name:** The "Self-Verifying Software" Meme
*   **Source:** `ARCHITECTURAL_VISION.md` - "Advanced Concepts: Injected Runtime Probes"
*   **Concept:** The ultimate goal of injecting eBPF probes directly into compiled binaries to create "fully self-verifying software artifacts." This concept borders on sentient software, capable of proving its own execution, and can be memed for its futuristic, perhaps slightly dystopian, implications.

### Conceptual Enums, Structs, and Functions

#### Enum `VerificationState`
```
enum VerificationState {
    Unverified,
    Probing,
    SelfVerifying,
    ProvenCorrect,
}
```

#### Struct `SelfVerifyingBinary`
```
struct SelfVerifyingBinary {
    name: string,
    hash: string,
    injected_probes: List<eBPFProbe>,
    current_verification_state: VerificationState,
    execution_proof_log: string,
}
```

#### Function `inject_probes(binary: CompiledBinary, probes: List<eBPFProbe>) -> SelfVerifyingBinary`
*   **Input:** `CompiledBinary` and a list of `eBPFProbe` objects.
*   **Output:** `SelfVerifyingBinary` (the binary with injected probes).
*   **Conceptual Logic:** Modifies a compiled binary to embed self-verification mechanisms.

#### Function `prove_execution(self_verifying_binary: SelfVerifyingBinary) -> ExecutionProof`
*   **Input:** `SelfVerifyingBinary`.
*   **Output:** `ExecutionProof` (cryptographic proof of correct execution).

#### Function `monitor_runtime_integrity(self_verifying_binary: SelfVerifyingBinary) -> VerificationState`
*   **Input:** `SelfVerifyingBinary`.
*   **Output:** `VerificationState` (the current state of its self-verification).

### Related Memes
*   "The Blockchain Everything" Meme (both deal with advanced verification and trust, potentially with over-engineering).
*   "The Smart Contract Submodule" Meme (related to self-contained, verifiable software components).
*   Any meme about AI sentience, advanced robotics, or the singularity.
*   Memes about "trustless" systems or ultimate security.
