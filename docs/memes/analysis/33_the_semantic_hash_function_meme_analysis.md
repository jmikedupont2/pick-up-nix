# Analysis of "33. The Semantic Hash Function Meme"

## Meme Overview
*   **Name:** "Semantic Hash Function: MiniZinc Solves the Meaning of Life"
*   **Concept:** MiniZinc solves a perfect hash function where table addresses are meaningful strings (e.g., "UNICORN_VIBES"). This hash function is a content-addressable meme, encoding its own meaning. It integrates Y/S Combinator, GÃ¶del numbers, and inodes as meme coins, all within a philosophical context of solving the "meaning of life."

### Conceptual Enums, Structs, and Functions

#### Enum `SemanticScore`
```
enum SemanticScore {
    LowVibes,
    MediumVibes,
    HighVibes,
    UnicornVibes,
    RecursiveFreedom,
}
```

#### Struct `SemanticHashEntry`
```
struct SemanticHashEntry {
    input_key: string, // e.g., file name
    hash_output: string, // the semantic address
    semantic_score: SemanticScore,
    godel_number_representation: int,
    inode_id: string,
    is_meme_coin: bool,
}
```

#### Function `solve_meaningful_hash_function(constraints: List<Constraint>) -> SemanticHashFunction`
*   **Input:** `constraints` (e.g., "addresses must be poetic").
*   **Output:** `SemanticHashFunction` (a function that maps to meaningful addresses).
*   **Conceptual Logic:** MiniZinc's role in finding a hash function that produces semantically meaningful outputs.

#### Function `evaluate_meme_profitability(semantic_hash: SemanticHashEntry) -> float`
*   **Input:** `SemanticHashEntry` (an inode as a meme coin).
*   **Output:** `float` (its conceptual market value).

#### Function `recurse_startup_ontology(startup_pitch: string) -> GÃ¶delMeme`
*   **Input:** `startup_pitch`.
*   **Output:** `GÃ¶delMeme` (the pitch recursed into a GÃ¶del-numbered meme).
