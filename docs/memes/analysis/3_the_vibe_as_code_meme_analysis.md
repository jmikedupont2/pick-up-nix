# Analysis of "3. The Vibe as Code" Meme

## Meme Overview
*   **Name:** The "Vibe as Code" Meme
*   **Source:** `task.md` - "Standards" section
*   **Concept:** The philosophical and artistic statement: "the vibe is the vector is the function is the poem is the code." This suggests a deep, almost spiritual connection between the project's aesthetic, its direction, its implementation, its artistic expression, and its core. It's relatable for developers who see coding as an art form.

#### Function `manifest_vibe_as_code(essence: ProjectEssence) -> Code`
*   **Input:** `ProjectEssence` (the core philosophical and artistic statement).
*   **Output:** `Code` (the manifestation of the vibe as executable code).
*   **Conceptual Logic:** Translates abstract aesthetic and philosophical principles into concrete, functional code, blurring the lines between art and engineering.

#### Function `interpret_code_as_poem(code: Code) -> Poem`
