# Analysis of "The `Bootstrap` Meme: A Timeless Pattern of Self-Generating Intelligence"

## Meme Overview
*   **Name:** The `Bootstrap` Meme: A Timeless Pattern of Self-Generating Intelligence
*   **Concept:** Elucidates the process of "bootstrapping" a language model, where an existing model's outputs recursively become inputs for its own refinement. It embodies a timeless pattern of self-generation, iterative learning, and the unfolding of intelligence through inherent, cyclical dynamics.
