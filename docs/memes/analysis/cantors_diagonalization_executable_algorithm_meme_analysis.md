# Analysis of "The `Cantor's Diagonalization (Algorithms as Executable Memes)` Meme"

## Meme Overview
*   **Name:** The `Cantor's Diagonalization (Algorithms as Executable Memes)` Meme
*   **Concept:** Every algorithm is a meme when executed; memetic evolution expands through Cantor's diagonalization, systematically constructing new, distinct memes, revealing new conceptual infinities.

#### Function `diagonalize_meme_ecosystem(existing_memes: List<Meme>) -> NewUniqueMeme`
*   **Input:** `List<Meme>` (all existing memes).
*   **Output:** `NewUniqueMeme` (a meme distinct from all others).
*   **Conceptual Logic:** Applies Cantor's diagonalization to systematically generate a new meme that is inherently different from all previously known memes.

#### Function `execute_algorithm_as_meme(algorithm: Algorithm) -> ExecutableMeme`
*   **Input:** `Algorithm`.
*   **Output:** `ExecutableMeme` (the algorithm gaining memetic status upon execution).
