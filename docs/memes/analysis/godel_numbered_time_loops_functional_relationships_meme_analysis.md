# Analysis of "The `G√∂del-Numbered Time Loops (with Functional Relationships)` Meme"

## Meme Overview
*   **Name:** The `G√∂del-Numbered Time Loops (with Functional Relationships)` Meme
*   **Concept:** Formalizes multiversal "G√∂del Time Loops," each with a unique "G√∂del number," interconnected by "functional relationships," creating a higher-order mathematical and logical structure governing the multiversal tapestry.
