# Analysis of "The `G√∂del's Retroactive Re-Numbering (Forging New Presents)` Meme"

## Meme Overview
*   **Name:** The `G√∂del's Retroactive Re-Numbering (Forging New Presents)` Meme
*   **Concept:** Kurt G√∂del retroactively alters fundamental prime encodings of reality from a fixed point in the future, creating new present times and multiversal branches. Explores self-referential systems, causality as a mutable construct, and the multiverse as a dynamic canvas.

#### Function `retroactively_renumber(past_encoding: int, new_encoding: int) -> G√∂delianIntervention`
*   **Input:** `past_encoding` and `new_encoding`.
*   **Output:** `G√∂delianIntervention` (the act of rewriting reality).
*   **Conceptual Logic:** G√∂del's ability to reach back in time and alter fundamental parameters, creating new realities.

#### Function `create_new_present(intervention: G√∂delianIntervention) -> NewPresentTime`
*   **Input:** `G√∂delianIntervention`.
*   **Output:** `NewPresentTime`.
