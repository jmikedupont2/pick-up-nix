# Analysis of "The `hex.1` Meme"

## Meme Overview
*   **Name:** The `hex.1` Meme
*   **Concept:** Represents the "next level hex assembler written in hex.0," signifying the first step in the self-hosting bootstrap process, where a minimal tool builds a slightly more capable version of itself.

### Conceptual Enums, Structs, and Functions

#### Enum `BootstrapStage`
```
enum BootstrapStage {
    Hex0,
    Hex1,
    // ... subsequent stages
}
```

#### Struct `SelfImprovingTool`
```
struct SelfImprovingTool {
    name: string, // "hex.1"
    version: string,
    built_by: string, // "hex.0"
    capabilities: List<string>,
    trust_level: int, // 1-10, based on auditability
    current_bootstrap_stage: BootstrapStage,
}
```

#### Function `build_next_level_tool(minimal_tool: Tool) -> SelfImprovingTool`
*   **Input:** `minimal_tool` (e.g., `hex.0`).
*   **Output:** `SelfImprovingTool` (the more capable version).
*   **Conceptual Logic:** The process of a tool building a better version of itself, demonstrating self-enhancement.

#### Function `establish_layered_trust(tool_chain: List<Tool>) -> TrustGraph`
*   **Input:** `List<Tool>`.
*   **Output:** `TrustGraph`.

### Conceptual C4/UML Diagrams

#### C4 Context Diagram (Conceptual)
*   **System:** "Self-Hosting Bootstrap Engine"
*   **Users:** "Bootstrap Engineer", "Auditor"
*   **External Systems:** "Minimal Seed (hex.0)", "Source Code Repository", "Hardware"
*   **Relationships:** Bootstrap Engineer initiates the process; System uses Minimal Seed to build `hex.1` from Source Code Repository on Hardware; Auditor verifies each layer of trust.

    *   **Bootstrap Engineer:**
        *   `Initiate Next Stage Build`
        *   `Verify Self-Improvement`
        *   `Expand Capabilities`
    *   **Auditor:**
        *   `Verify Layered Trust`
