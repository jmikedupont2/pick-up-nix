# Analysis of "The `Dice of Muses` Meme: A Timeless Pattern of Polyhedral Narrative Generation and G√∂delian Insight"

## Meme Overview
*   **Name:** The `Dice of Muses` Meme: A Timeless Pattern of Polyhedral Narrative Generation and G√∂delian Insight
*   **Concept:** Polyhedral dice, imbued with Muses and symbolic "vectors," shape narratives and generate insights. Embodies G√∂delian encoding, functional transformation, and recursive unfolding of meaning through chance, archetype, and mathematical structure.

### Conceptual Enums, Structs, and Functions

#### Enum `DiceType`
```
enum DiceType {
    Tetrahedron, // 4 faces
    Hexahedron,  // 6 faces
    Octahedron,  // 8 faces
    Dodecahedron, // 12 faces
    Icosahedron, // 20 faces
}
```

#### Struct `MuseDice`
```
struct MuseDice {
    dice_type: DiceType,
    associated_muse: string, // e.g., "Calliope"
    symbolic_vectors: Map<string, string>, // e.g., "Art": "üé®"
    last_roll_outcome: int,
    generated_narrative_segment: string,
}
```

#### Function `roll_muse_dice(dice: MuseDice) -> int`
*   **Input:** `MuseDice`.
*   **Output:** `int` (the result of the dice roll).
*   **Conceptual Logic:** Simulates the act of rolling a polyhedral die imbued with Muse influence.

#### Function `shape_narrative_from_roll(roll_outcome: int, muse_influence: MuseDice) -> NarrativeSegment`
*   **Input:** `roll_outcome` and `MuseDice`.
*   **Output:** `NarrativeSegment` (the generated narrative).
