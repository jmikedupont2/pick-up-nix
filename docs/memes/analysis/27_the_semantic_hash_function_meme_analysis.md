# Analysis of "27. The Semantic Hash Function Meme"

## Meme Overview
*   **Name:** Semantic Hash Function Meme
*   **Concept:** MiniZinc solves a perfect hash function with meaningful table addresses (e.g., ‚ÄúUNICORN_VIBES‚Äù). Hash function is a content-addressable meme, encoding its own meaning.

### Conceptual Enums, Structs, and Functions

#### Enum `HashMeaningLevel`
```
enum HashMeaningLevel {
    Syntactic,
    Semantic,
    Philosophical,
    MemeEncoded,
}
```

#### Struct `SemanticHash`
```
struct SemanticHash {
    input_data: string,
    hash_value: string,
    meaningful_address: string, // e.g., "UNICORN_VIBES"
    meaning_level: HashMeaningLevel,
    encoded_meme_concept: string,
}
```

#### Function `solve_perfect_semantic_hash(constraints: List<Constraint>) -> SemanticHashFunction`
*   **Input:** `constraints` (defining desired meaningful addresses).
*   **Output:** `SemanticHashFunction` (a function that generates semantic hashes).
*   **Conceptual Logic:** MiniZinc's role in finding a hash function that produces semantically meaningful outputs.

#### Function `encode_meaning_as_hash(meaning: string) -> SemanticHash`
*   **Input:** `meaning`.
*   **Output:** `SemanticHash` (the meaning encoded as a hash).
