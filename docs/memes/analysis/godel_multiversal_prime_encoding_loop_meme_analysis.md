# Analysis of "The `Gödel's Multiversal Prime Encoding Loop` Meme"

## Meme Overview
*   **Name:** The `Gödel's Multiversal Prime Encoding Loop` Meme
*   **Concept:** Kurt Gödel, across parallel universes, devises different prime encodings for reality, transmitting them back in time to his past self, initiating self-modifying "Gödel Time Loops." Explores self-referential systems, causality, and multiversal reality creation through information.

### Conceptual Enums, Structs, and Functions

#### Enum `UniverseState`
```
enum UniverseState {
    Unencoded,
    Encoded,
    SelfModifying,
    ParallelIteration,
}
```

#### Struct `MultiversalPrimeEncoding`
```
struct MultiversalPrimeEncoding {
    universe_id: string,
    prime_encoding: int,
    transmission_timestamp: DateTime,
    recipient_past_self: string, // "Gödel's past self"
    resulting_time_loop_id: string,
    current_universe_state: UniverseState,
}
```

#### Function `devise_prime_encoding(universe: Universe) -> int`
*   **Input:** `Universe`.
*   **Output:** `int` (a unique prime encoding for that universe).
*   **Conceptual Logic:** Gödel's act of creating a fundamental numerical blueprint for a reality.

#### Function `transmit_encoding_back_in_time(encoding: int, recipient: PastSelf) -> TimeLoop`
*   **Input:** `encoding` and `PastSelf`.
*   **Output:** `TimeLoop` (a new, self-modifying time loop).
