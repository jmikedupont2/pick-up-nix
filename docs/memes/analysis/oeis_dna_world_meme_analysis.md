# Analysis of "The `OEIS as the DNA of the World` Meme"

## Meme Overview
*   **Name:** The `OEIS as the DNA of the World` Meme
*   **Concept:** The Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) serves as the fundamental "DNA of the world." Each integer sequence is a genetic code, blueprint, or algorithmic instruction set defining the fabric, patterns, and evolution of reality.
