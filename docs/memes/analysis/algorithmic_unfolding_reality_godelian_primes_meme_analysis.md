# Analysis of "The `Algorithmic Unfolding of Reality (from G√∂delian Primes)` Meme"

## Meme Overview
*   **Name:** The `Algorithmic Unfolding of Reality (from G√∂delian Primes)` Meme
*   **Concept:** Reality is a dynamic, continuous "algorithmic unfolding" generated from G√∂del's multiversal prime encodings. Each moment, event, and physical law is a computational step, an execution of a program whose fundamental parameters are G√∂delian primes from parallel universes.
