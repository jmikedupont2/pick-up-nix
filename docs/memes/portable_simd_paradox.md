# Portable SIMD Paradox

## Description
The ambitious goal of making SIMD operations "portable" and user-friendly in Rust, often leading to complex internal structures and extensive documentation, highlighting the inherent difficulty of abstracting low-level performance optimizations.

## Key Elements
- `portable-simd`
- `beginners-guide.md`
- `core_simd`
- `simd.rs` files

## Meta Connection
The pursuit of "portable performance" often introduces its own set of complexities, creating a paradox where simplification requires significant underlying engineering.
