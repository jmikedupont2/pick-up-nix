## 14. The "`derivations.jsonl` as the Project's Soul" (Dank Quasi-Meta-Meme)
*   **Source:** `derivations.jsonl` (output of `nixtract`), `task.md` ("vibe is the vector..."), `IDEAS.md` ("monadic form").
*   **Concept:** A very abstract meme suggesting that the `derivations.jsonl` file, which represents the project's dependency graph, is not just data but the very essence or "soul" of the project. It's a deep dive into the philosophical implications of a fully traceable and reproducible build.
*   **Meme Idea:** A glowing `derivations.jsonl` file, or a character looking intently at the JSONL output as if divining secrets from it.
