# Sci-Rust SIMD Supercluster

## Description
The extensive and highly optimized `scirs` ecosystem in Rust, characterized by numerous specialized crates and pervasive SIMD integration, forming a "supercluster" of scientific computing capabilities.

## Key Elements
- `scirs` prefix
- many sub-crates
- `simd.rs`
- `simd_` examples/benchmarks
- scientific domains (linalg, fft, neural, spatial, etc.)

## Meta Connection
Represents the ambition to build a comprehensive, high-performance scientific computing stack in Rust, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with low-level optimizations and domain-specific libraries. It's a testament to the power of Rust and SIMD in scientific endeavors.
