## 13. The "`.` (dot) as a Universal Path" (Dank Quasi-Meta-Meme)
*   **Source:** The `.` in `././home/emacs.nix` and the philosophical idea of a "universal representation" from `IDEAS.md`.
*   **Concept:** A highly abstract and ironic meme playing on the seemingly trivial `.` (dot) in file paths, elevating it to a symbol of universal truth or a fundamental building block of the project's "monadic" structure. It's a nod to the subtle complexities within seemingly simple constructs.
*   **Meme Idea:** A single dot `.` with a halo, or a philosophical quote attributed to "The Dot."
