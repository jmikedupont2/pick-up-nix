# The `GNU Mes (Bootstrap Component)` Meme

This meme specifically refers to "A Scheme interpreter written in C, with cpp transformed into M2," as described in the GNU Mes `BOOTSTRAP` document. In this context, GNU Mes is a crucial component within the larger bootstrap chain, enabling the execution of Scheme code and serving as a stepping stone towards a full C compiler.

## Meme Aspects:
- **The Scheme Engine**: The ability to interpret Scheme, a powerful and flexible language, within the bootstrap.
- **Language Interoperability**: The transformation of C preprocessor output into M2, highlighting the bridging of different language paradigms.
- **The Interpreter's Role**: The importance of an interpreter in building a compiler, demonstrating a layered approach to language implementation.

## Key Elements:
- **Concept**: Scheme interpreter in the bootstrap chain.
- **Implementation**: Written in C, with preprocessor transformed to M2.
- **Role**: A vital part of the GNU Mes bootstrap, contributing to the "Maxwell's Equation of Software" by providing a Scheme execution environment for subsequent stages.
