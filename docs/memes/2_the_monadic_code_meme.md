## 2. The "Monadic Code" Meme
*   **Source:** `task.md` - "Standards" section; `IDEAS.md` - "Philosophical Goal"
*   **Concept:** The pursuit of extreme theoretical purity and abstraction in code, expressed through phrases like "Pure functional monotonic mondaic lattice oriented code" and "the fundamental 'monadic form' of software dependency management." It's a humorous take on complex functional programming concepts and the desire for elegant, mathematically-grounded solutions.
*   **Meme Idea:** A wizard casting a spell with complex mathematical symbols, or a highly abstract diagram with arrows pointing to "monads" and "lattices."
