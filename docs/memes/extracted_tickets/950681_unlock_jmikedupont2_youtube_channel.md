There is no graphic sexual.content
So there were two mentions of things sexual in my stream that i can remember. We talked about this viral video with those girls but did not discuss the content
 We talked about how in jugoslavia they had no age restrictions for pornogrqphy being sold to minors. I dont think we were explicit. It seems a little heavy handed to ban me. We can edit out those parts and be more careful on the future. This is really the first time i even thought about this possibility. It feels more like censorship than anything else.

I was told by someone he posted some porn in our unmonitored groupchat that might have caused the issue. Was that it?

I have a confession from the guy Bob who admits to posting p*** on our live stream that I wasn't watching and we don't use lifestreams anymore at all for that technology so there's no possibility of that happening ever again so I take responsibility for not monitoring the life chat I didn't even know that someone was log in there
