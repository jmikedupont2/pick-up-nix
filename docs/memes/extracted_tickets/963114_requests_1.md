### Website and Social Media Updates
- Update the link to the new website.

  - Replace "zos-sfm founder" with "official 
@zos_sfm
 Twitter account."
- Update Mike’s Linktree:
  - Include the official SFM website.
  - Include the official Twitter account.
- Ensure "solfunmeme" is included in the Twitter account name or at least in the bio:
  - "Manage and Host your own AI token with one click *Solfunmeme* CA: BwUTq7fS6sfUmHDwAiCQZ3asSiPEapW5zDrsbwtapump."
- Execute a general clean rebrand.

### Communication Strategy
- Increase updates/tweets from the main Twitter account:
  - Consider quote tweeting Mike's restream on the 
@zos_sfm
 account to summarize completed work.
- Provide GitHub/Codeberg explanations:
  - Consider creating a GitBook for documentation; offer assistance or take on the project.
- Avoid discussing price or posting SFM charts:
  - Acknowledge that discussing price is generally taboo for developers on crypto Twitter.
- Share general SFM explanations on Twitter:
  - Address common questions about what SFM is, as many users may not know
