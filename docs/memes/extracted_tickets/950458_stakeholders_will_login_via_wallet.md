stakeholders will login via the phantom wallet compatible web app with wallet and be able to vote on important decisions :
1. who is admin in telegram,discord etc.
2. what versions of what bots with what permissions do we have in telegram
3. what software projects are important to work on
4. what marketing and listing should we persue
5.  etc.

This will be the core of the dao, I will use this as my oracle for every day decisions and try and act in the best interest of the team and hope all of us will.

We are going to build something amazing, I have tons of work ready, many ideas ready to launch when we have this running.
