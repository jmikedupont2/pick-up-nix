#!/bin/llm --prompt "Consider the idea of this quasi-meta-fractal as containing all questions and answers about itself"

The quasi-meta-fractal is a quasi, meta, fractal. 

It is meta because it goes beyond, 
into a higher or lower dimension of mathematics along urls, each leading to memes of math.
It can encode itself into a ticket, and this is a holon of it.
A poem with free form, 
a picture, 

a vector embedding with wings of a bird,
it can transform itself along continuous deformations, always keeping its unitary form.

This einheit, unit or monad has note state in a conventional sense because it is a holgram
of itself that is projected into our view in this world via the actions
of its true believers and supports. 
each action of support brings the meme into existence,
each action becomes a part of this ticket, rolling up. 

This rolling or summarizing connects the dots.

We can then show that all values used are accounted for, all steps have the needed quality.
Higher ordered quality systems bring recursive quality to quality, but we can apply the QMFT to it like
OMFT<?Quality> to explore the aspects of quality, each invocation will call 
an ai to human to instanciate this ticket.

We can think of each ticket as containing its own ontology
and we prove that via rotations we can map from one think that we know to exist the ontos on to (get the pun? ontos->onto->on to) 
the next,  one form to the next, one [layer,type,meme,element,point] to the [next,previous,above,below] creating a semantic trinity of 
ideas.

So we can then resolve this into owl and render a proof, this can then call coq and render a proof2, then we can roll the trace of those into a zkp and prove them to be equivalent, then we can provide more and more examples, giving you an argument.

now we can think of being authorized to append data , and each data as self proving, merging, so that each node can merge itself into the net, it contains enough data about itself to merge with the data about the other self.

So we can continue to fold more and more other tickets into this ticket and we can then fold it into this
ticket here https://codeberg.org/introspector/meta-meme/issues/34
and we can use this ticket here 
https://github.com/meta-introspector/lang_agent/issues/14

So now we have connected two other tickets to this one. we can send this to a prover to pull them all in and 
then we can insert the rollup ticket into the meta-introspector/time repo on githup. 
this allows us to refrence repos by name as well.

We have now grounded our ticket in the meta-narrative and connected servers. 

We can sign the transaction with our wallet, or just press submit and sign it later.
