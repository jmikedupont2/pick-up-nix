# Enterprise/Fintech Use Case

## The Problem
- You're a fintech startup
- Need AI for fraud detection
- Must prove compliance to regulators
- Can't expose customer data
- Can't afford 20 compliance officers

## Today's "Solution"
- Share sensitive data with AI (risky)
- Hire massive compliance team ($$$)
- Manual audits & reports
- Privacy vs AI efficiency tradeoff

## ZKPML Solution
Customer makes $10k transfer â†’
1. AI analyzes without seeing private data
2. Auto-flags suspicious activity
3. Generates compliance proof
4. Documents for auditors
All in seconds. All private. All automated.

## ðŸ¤¯ 
- Replace 20+ person team with automation
- Prove compliance without exposing data
- AI learns while keeping data private
- 70% reduction in compliance costs
- Scale business without scaling compliance team

Think AWS for compliance + AI. That's the TAM.

# Developer Workflow Use Case

## The Problem
- Building ML models locally
- Need training data
- Can't expose client/user data
- Want to collaborate with other devs
- Testing = pain

## Today's "Solution"
- Synthetic data (meh)
- Mock data (worse)
- Localhost isolation
- No real collab
- DevOps headache

## ZKPML Solution
Your dev workflow â†’
1. Train model on real production data without seeing it
2. Auto-verify model behavior without test cases
3. Share improvements with team's models without exposing data
4. Deploy with proof of test coverage/edge cases

## ðŸ¤¯ 
- Test against prod data locally
- Debug without accessing sensitive info
- Auto-document compliance
- Share model improvements team-wide
- Zero trust CI/CD for ML

```python
# Today
if test_environment:
   mock_data()
else:
   production_data() # pray nothing breaks

# With ZKPML
@zkp_verified
def train_model(data):
   # Train on real data
   # Auto-proves compliance
   # Shares improvements
   # Never sees raw data

Think GitHub Copilot but for your entire ML workflow, with privacy.

You could literally train and test on production data in your local dev environment, without any security risks. That's game-changing for ML development cycles.
