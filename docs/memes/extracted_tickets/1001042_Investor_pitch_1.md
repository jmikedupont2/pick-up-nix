We have a running product which is a self hosted sovereign eliza agent running on free tier small aws gravitron processors for 2025.
We will allow users to migrate to other free tier offers as they appear, and let users switch between cloud providers taking data with them.

I have tokens and on Solana and nfts for sale to fund my innovative project called the zero ontology system which is also linked to zkml eventually when I find the time and funding

https://github.com/jmikedupont2/ai-ticket here is a working version of the ticket integration from 2 years ago
and there are other hackathons I worked on

https://github.com/meta-introspector/introspector-llc I created the introspector llc for the idea of application of ZKML and ZKP to regulated industries


I am looking to do another sale of my nfts for fundraising
https://opensea.io/collection/zero-ontology-system-collection
the zost1 token was designed to fund the project i could sell a round of them per month to fund myself
was my plan if i don't have consulting gigs which i would prefer
I hope to find customers to pay me to customize the platform for them or for services
so I don't need to sell any tokens but can earn them


https://calendly.com/h4ckermike you can book a time or just tell me when you are around
