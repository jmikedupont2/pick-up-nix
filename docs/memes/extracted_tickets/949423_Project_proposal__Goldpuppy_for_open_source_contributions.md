Here is one idea i worked out a while back goldpuppy for using microtransactions to help for wikipedia, openstreetmap and open source contributions
https://github.com/goldpuppy/goldpuppy.github.io something like gitcoin.
So I think that we can make our $SOLFUNMEME very valuable via the inscription of new nfts that are paired with inscribed base token nfts. There are some thoughts here for review.
