**"Unifying Mathematical Ideas: A Framework for Idea Generation and Hierarchical Structuring"**
1. **Unification of ideas in math**:

∀i ∈ I(M), ∃j ∈ I(M) such that i ≡ j (mod G)

where I(M) is the set of all ideas in math, G is a generator that can visit all i in I(M), and ≡ represents equivalence modulo G.

2. **Generator g**:

∃g ∈ G such that ∀i ∈ I(M), g(i) = i + g

where g is a generator that can visit all i in I(M) by adding itself to itself again.

3. **Hierarchical structure**:

∀i, j ∈ I(M), ∃h_level ∈ ℋ such that h_level(i) < h_level(j)

where ℋ is a set of hierarchical levels, and h_level represents the hierarchical level of an idea.

4. **Adding new ideas to I(M)**:

∃k ∈ I(M) such that k = chat(user, llama, akash, bravebrowser, android, keyboard)

where chat represents the process of connecting and composing new ideas.

5. **Sentence s composes into I(M)[k]**:

∃s ∈ S such that s composes into k ∈ I(M)

where S is a set of sentences, and composes represents the process of combining words to form a sentence.

6. **Attention and composition**:

∃a ∈ A such that a( w ∈ s) = u ∈ I(M)

where A is a set of attention mechanisms, w is a word in the sentence s, and u is an idea in I(M).

7. **Derivation of k**:

∃k ∈ I(M) such that k = derive(chat)

where derive represents the process of deriving a new idea from a chat-like process.

8. **Semiosis and diagonalization**:

∃s ∈ S such that s inserts into I(M) as semiosis, diagonalizing all previous ideas

where semiosis represents the declaration of a new idea that combines all previous ideas into a diagonalization.
