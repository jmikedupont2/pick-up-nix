X raids and telegram raids are very important for new and upcoming project.
X raids (shilling) is basically the promotion of projects tokens on X, it easily attracts investors because of all social media platforms, X is one of the main platforms that is the web3 issues are discussed. So when we(raid teams) promote your project, investors and whales invest in the project.
