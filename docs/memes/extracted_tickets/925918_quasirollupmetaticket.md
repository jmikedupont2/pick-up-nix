The QRUMT  (Quasi Roll Up Meta Ticket) is a Ticket like the Meta-Meme is a Meme. 
A meme has a representation, and this meta-ticket is also a URL. 

This ticket url is THIS_TICKET_URL. 
That english statement can be translated to a RDF statement, any rdf can be URL encoded.

So we can in include the url of this ticket back into this ticket after it is assigned when we say "create issue",

the action is to click on THE_CREATE_ISSUE button. 
This is the trigger of the action that will occur.

For example a program watching this projects feed could notice there is a new ticket, 
it could poll or be notified by some back end action.

So we can create a system for anyone to login to THIS_SITE_URL and to ADD a USER_COMMENT to THIS_TICKET.

So we have now defined our meta-langage ML by example.
Now we can treat this ticket as meta-ticket or a template-ticket, it goes beyond being a ticket,
it can be seen as part , a fragment, a holon, something that contains itself recursively, but rationally. 
If we consider a recursive logarithmic containment of self, like escher, then it will get smaller and we
can truncate this sequence at any depth.

Now we send this to the ai for response, we append those results and then we can sign it as funding or review request later.
we can append urls that reference other shards of threads or mycillium or holons of this meta-ticket to this ticket or its meta ticket
and we can see those as recursive fractals of this starting point.
