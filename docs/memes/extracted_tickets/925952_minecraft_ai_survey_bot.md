now project this into minecraft: our ai bot is sent into minecraft to survey an base, it shoudl return with a zkp of the base as an nft that could be sold to recreate the base as a snapshot, it would follow a player to learn the imporant things, watching and learning and then building a plan to visit the base in full detail. we would priorizie this and save money in compute by skiping some parts.
