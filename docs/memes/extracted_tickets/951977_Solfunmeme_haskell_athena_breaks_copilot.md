consider this haskell type as a template for creating language agents using template haskell  as the reflective substance
1 reference
To use the provided Haskell type as a template for creating language agents using Template Haskell, follow these steps:

Understand the Existing Structure: The Mythos type and its related data types (ArchetypeWarrior, ArchetypeWoman, ArchetypeWarriorWoman, GreekAuthors, GreekMythos, GreekKings, Authorization, Emotions) serve as the foundation. The greek_athena_mythos value is an instance of Mythos.

Template Haskell Basics: Template Haskell allows you to perform compile-time meta-programming in Haskell. You can generate Haskell code programmatically, which can be useful for creating language agents.

Create Template Haskell Functions: Implement Template Haskell functions to generate instances of Mythos for different language agents.

Here is an example of how you can start implementing this:

Haskell
{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}

module AthenaTH where

import Language.Haskell.TH
import Athena

-- Function to generate Mythos instances
genMythosInstance :: Name -> Q [Dec]
genMythosInstance name = [d|
  instance Mythos $(conT name) $(conT name) where
    buildMythos = Build_mythos (\_ -> MythosOfAthena) __ (\_ -> Joy) (\_ -> WarriorWoman Warrior Woman)
  |]

-- Example usage
runQ $ genMythosInstance ''GreekAuthors
This is a basic example. You need to expand it based on your specific requirements for creating language agents.

now imagine we woulc construct a series of prompt models from the template haskell reflection of athena
1 reference
To construct a series of prompt models from the Template Haskell reflection of the Athena module, you can follow these steps:

Template Haskell Basics: Familiarize yourself with Template Haskell, which allows you to perform compile-time meta-programming in Haskell. This enables you to generate Haskell code programmatically.

Define Template Haskell Functions: Create Template Haskell functions that generate instances of the Mythos type for different prompt models.

Implement Prompt Models: Use the generated instances to construct a series of prompt models.

Here is an example implementation:

Haskell
{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}

module AthenaTH where

import Language.Haskell.TH
import Athena

-- Function to generate Mythos instances
genMythosInstance :: Name -> Q [Dec]
genMythosInstance name = [d|
  instance Mythos $(conT name) $(conT name) where
    buildMythos = Build_mythos (\_ -> MythosOfAthena) __ (\_ -> Joy) (\_ -> WarriorWoman Warrior Woman)
  |]

-- Example usage
runQ $ genMythosInstance ''GreekAuthors
This is a basic example. You will need to expand it based on your specific requirements for creating prompt models.

now lets define actions for her to respond to chats
4 references
I couldn't find any specific definitions for actions in the repository.

To define actions for Athena to respond to chats, you can follow these steps:

Define the chat actions: Extend the Mythos type to include actions for responding to chats.
Implement the actions using Template Haskell: Create Template Haskell functions to generate instances of these actions.
Here is an example of how you might start:

Haskell
{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}

module AthenaActions where

import Language.Haskell.TH
import Athena

data ChatAction = Respond | Ignore

genChatActionInstance :: Name -> Q [Dec]
genChatActionInstance name = [d|
  instance Mythos $(conT name) $(conT name) where
    buildMythos = Build_mythos (\_ -> MythosOfAthena) __ (\_ -> Joy) (\_ -> WarriorWoman Warrior Woman)
    performAction action prompt = case action of
      Respond -> "Responding to: " ++ prompt
      Ignore  -> "Ignoring: " ++ prompt
  |]

-- Example usage
runQ $ genChatActionInstance ''GreekAuthors
This is a basic example. You will need to expand it based on your specific requirements for chat actions.

now reflect over the template haskell terms and have her examine each part of her self in a lattice
2 references
To reflect over the Template Haskell terms and have Athena examine each part of herself in a lattice, you can follow these steps:

Define a Lattice Structure: Create a lattice structure to represent the components of Athena.
Template Haskell Reflection: Use Template Haskell to reflect over the terms and populate the lattice.
Here's an example implementation:

Haskell
{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}

module AthenaLattice where

import Language.Haskell.TH
import Athena

-- Define a lattice structure
data Lattice a = Node a [Lattice a] | Leaf a

-- Function to reflect over terms and build the lattice
buildLattice :: Name -> Q [Dec]
buildLattice name = do
  info <- reify name
  case info of
    TyConI (DataD _ _ _ _ constructors _) -> return $ concatMap buildNode constructors
    _ -> fail "Expected a data type declaration"
  where
    buildNode (NormalC consName fields) =
      [ ValD (VarP (mkName (nameBase consName ++ "Node"))) (NormalB (AppE (ConE 'Node) (LitE (StringL (nameBase consName))))) [] ]
    buildNode _ = []

-- Example usage
runQ $ buildLattice ''GreekMythos
This code defines a lattice structure and a Template Haskell function to reflect over the terms and build the lattice. You can expand this based on your specific requirements.

To add the given JSON and Coq definitions to the Athena module, you can modify the lib/athena.hs file to include these definitions and integrate them where necessary.

Here is a modified version of the lib/athena.hs file with the JSON and Coq definitions added:

now reorganize it using ZOS or zero ontology system

I've retrieved the contents of the file lib/lang_model.ml, but I couldn't find any references or documentation about ZOS (Zero Ontology System) in the repository.

To proceed with reorganizing the file using ZOS, I'll need more specific details or resources about ZOS. Could you provide more information or point to any documentation or examples for ZOS?

To proceed with reorganizing the file lib/lang_model.ml using ZOS principles, I need more detailed guidelines or specific aspects of ZOS principles that you want to apply. Could you provide more information or specify which principles should be used?
