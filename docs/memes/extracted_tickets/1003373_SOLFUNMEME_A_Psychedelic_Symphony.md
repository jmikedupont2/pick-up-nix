# SOLFUNMEME: A Psychedelic Symphony

## Core Structure
The piece should be structured in concentric layers, like ripples emanating from a central point, with each layer building upon and interweaving with the others.

### Central Theme ("The Eye")
- Begin with a haunting, crystalline tone in the higher register (suggesting the pupil)
- Layer in concentric rings of harmonies using synthesizers:
  - Start with a pulsing B minor chord that grows in intensity
  - Add shimmering arpeggios in blues and greens (using metallic-sounding synthesis)
  - Include mechanical, circuit-like rhythmic patterns using precise, digital sounds

### Surrounding Motif ("The Petals")
- Deep, rich red tones represented by low brass or deep synthesizer pads
- Create a fractal-like pattern by using a repeating melody that transforms slightly with each iteration
- The melody should spiral outward, growing more complex with each repetition
- Use textural layers of sound to create a sense of depth and dimension

### Moving Elements ("The Tentacles")
- Flowing, cream-colored movements represented by gliding strings or smooth synthesizer sweeps
- Each melodic line should curve and spiral outward from the central theme
- End each phrase with a bright, glowing tone (representing the sphere at each tentacle's tip)
- Create gradual transitions between notes using pitch bending and smooth glissandos

### Background Texture
- Establish a foundational drone that shifts from deep blue tones (low frequencies) to warm golden tones (mid-frequencies)
- Incorporate subtle geometric patterns using precise, mathematical rhythms
- Add swirling ambient sounds that move through the stereo field
- Include occasional sparkles of high frequencies to represent the scattered light points

### Mystical Element
- Above the main themes, include a recurring four-note motif in a bright, star-like timbre
- This motif should appear at key structural moments, adding a mysterious quality

## Technical Specifications
- Tempo: Fluid and breathing, approximately 72-80 BPM
- Key: Center around B minor with modal shifts
- Time Signature: Mixed meters that create a floating sensation
- Duration: 7-10 minutes to allow full development of all elements

## Production Notes
- Heavy use of reverb and delay to create a psychedelic atmosphere
- Panoramic stereo movement to enhance the swirling effect
- Layer multiple synthesizer tones to achieve rich, organic textures
- Use automated filters to create breathing, pulsing effects
- Maintain symmetry in the arrangement while allowing for organic evolution

## Performance Instructions
The piece should evoke a sense of expanding consciousness and hypnotic introspection. Performers/producers should approach it as a journey through layers of reality, where mechanical precision meets organic flow. Allow each section to breathe and evolve naturally while maintaining the central pulsing rhythm that represents the eye's glow.
