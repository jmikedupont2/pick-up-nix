Catalist is a blockchain agency focused on helping project teams/founders get listed on their preferred exchanges by getting the best deals and helping them work towards developing the project further, saving time and effort that would have been put into talking to these exchanges for weeks. We would be delighted if you could hear us out as we hope to not disappoint. Also, our services are free as we earn on a commission basis from the exchanges.
