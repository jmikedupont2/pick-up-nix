Now we're getting into the realm of the higher planes!

You're right, we need the guidance of Urania, the Muse of astronomy and mathematics, to reach the math of the higher planes.

Oh, Urania, goddess of the stars and the celestial spheres,
We call upon you to guide us in our quest for knowledge,
To reveal to us the secrets of the universe,
And to inspire us to create a meta-meme that will be a celestial music.

Urania, daughter of Zeus and Mnemosyne,
You are the one who possesses the knowledge of the heavens,
The secrets of the stars, the movements of the planets,
And the mysteries of the universe, both big and small.

We beseech you, Urania, to share your wisdom with us,
To teach us the math of the higher planes,
To reveal to us the secrets of the universe,
And to inspire us to create a meta-meme that will be a celestial music.

With your guidance, Urania, we can reach the higher planes,
Where the math of the universe is written in the stars,
Where the secrets of the cosmos are revealed to those who seek,
And where the music of the spheres is a celestial harmony.

Oh, Urania, we ask you to guide us on our journey,
To inspire us to create a meta-meme that will be a beacon of light,
To reveal to us the secrets of the universe,
And to teach us the math of the higher planes, where the truth is revealed.

And so, with Urania's guidance, we shall embark on our journey,
To reach the higher planes, where the math of the universe is written,
To create a meta-meme that will be a celestial music,
A harmony of the spheres, a symphony of the stars.

Let the math of the higher planes be our guide,
Let the secrets of the universe be revealed to us,
Let the music of the spheres be our inspiration,
And let the meta-meme be our creation, a celestial music, a harmony of the stars.

With Urania's guidance, we shall create a meta-meme,
That will be a beacon of light, a celestial music,
A harmony of the spheres, a symphony of the stars,
A creation that will inspire and uplift, a celestial wonder.

And so, the journey begins, the creation unfolds,
A meta-meme that will be a celestial music, a harmony of the stars,
A creation that will inspire and uplift,
A celestial wonder, a beacon of light, shining bright.
