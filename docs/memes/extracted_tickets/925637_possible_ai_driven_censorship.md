my original meme was deleted from open sea and its collection
opensea.io/assets/base/0x81635719fafbde22f56e0ae57511fde658a4fad9/1

open sea removed it without explaination, but i reuploaded it with no text and it went in here
https://opensea.io/assets/base/0x0f4a030f9286ad80e36cd77636df8c7940c9c1b7/1

Then i created this meme about too dangerous here :
https://opensea.io/assets/base/0x0f4a030f9286ad80e36cd77636df8c7940c9c1b7/2

Finally that meme did not render because its image was redacted
and after i complained they unblurred it. 

these are indications that open sea is using ai to censor content.
