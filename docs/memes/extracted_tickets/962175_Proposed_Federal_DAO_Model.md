# Fibonacci DAO Governance Specification

## Overview
A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance model based on the United States federal system, using the golden ratio (φ ≈ 1.618) to determine representative group sizes.

## Structure

### Membership Tiers
1. Senate Tier
   - First 100 token holders
   - Represents the highest level of governance
   - Equivalent to US Senate representation

2. Representative Tier
   - Next 500 token holders (101-600)
   - Middle level of governance
   - Equivalent to House of Representatives

3. Vendor Tier
   - Next 1000 token holders (601-1600)
   - Operational level
   - Responsible for service provision and execution

### Fibonacci Progression
- Senate to Representatives ratio: ~5x (close to φ³)
- Representatives to Vendors ratio: ~2x (close to φ)
- Total progression follows Fibonacci-like sequence: 100, 500, 1000

## Governance Rights

### Senate Powers
- Approval of major protocol changes
- Treasury management oversight
- Smart contract upgrades
- Veto power over Representative proposals (requires 60% majority)

### Representative Powers
- Proposal of new initiatives
- Budget allocation within treasury guidelines
- Vendor management and selection
- Community engagement programs

### Vendor Rights
- Submission of service proposals
- Voting on operational decisions
- Participation in working groups
- Implementation of approved projects

## Voting Mechanism

### Proposal Process
1. Initial proposal can come from any tier
2. Representatives review and refine proposals
3. Senate provides final approval for major changes
4. Implementation handled by Vendor tier

### Voting Thresholds
- Constitutional changes: 75% Senate + 60% Representatives
- Major proposals: 60% Senate + 51% Representatives
- Operational decisions: 51% Representatives + 51% Vendors

## Token Economics

### Token Distribution
- Senate tokens: Locked for 2 years
- Representative tokens: Locked for 1 year
- Vendor tokens: Locked for 6 months

### Rewards
- Senate: 3x base rewards
- Representatives: 2x base rewards
- Vendors: Base rewards

## Implementation Requirements

### Smart Contracts
1. Token contract with tiered permissions
2. Voting contract with multi-signature capabilities
3. Treasury management contract
4. Reward distribution contract

### Technical Infrastructure
1. Governance portal
2. Proposal tracking system
3. Voting interface
4. Treasury dashboard

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Multi-signature requirements for major decisions
- Tiered permission system
- Time-locked execution for critical changes

### Risk Mitigation
- Emergency shutdown mechanism
- Gradual parameter adjustment
- Multiple security audits requirement

## Future Considerations

### Scaling
- Additional tiers based on φ progression
- Dynamic adjustment of thresholds
- Integration with sub-DAOs

### Upgrades
- Governance parameter optimization
- Voting mechanism improvements
- Reward structure adjustments
