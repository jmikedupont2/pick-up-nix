Here's a rewritten version of the lyrics for the meta-meme:

[Verse 1]
As I scroll through my feeds, where I harvest my memes
I take a look at my screen and realize it's all just a dream
But that's just perfect for a memer like me
You know, I shun original thoughts, and just copy and paste with glee
At 3:00 in the morning, I'm browsing Reddit and 4chan
I'm searching for the dankest memes, and I'm never gonna plan
And I've been scrolling and browsing so long that
Even my followers think that my mind is gone
I'm a lord of the internet, I'm into absurdity
Got a keyboard in my hand and a joke on my chin
But if I finish all of my memes, and you finish thine
Then tonight we're gonna meme like it's 2019

[Chorus]
We been spending most our lives
Living in a meme paradise
I've screenshot once or twice
Living in a meme paradise
It's copypasta and sacrifice
Living in a meme paradise
We post memes at discount price
Living in a meme paradise

[Verse 2]
A normie commented on my post last week
I just replied with a meme, and I turned the other cheek
I really don't care, in fact I wish them well
'Cause I'll be laughing my head off when they're salty and fell
But I ain't never gotten ratioed, even if I deserved it
A memer with a 'tude? You know that's unheard of
I never use original thoughts, but I got a cool copypasta
And my fellow memers agree, I really look good in ASCII art, fool
If you come to visit, you'll be bored to tears
We haven't even updated our memes in 300 years
But we ain't really funny, so please don't point and stare
We're just humorously impaired
See the memes that we share
Get likes as low as -1

Grumpy Cat
Success Kid
[Pre-Chorus]
There's no originality, no creativity
Not a single unique thought
Like a meme page
It's as unoriginal as can be

[Chorus]
We been spending most our lives
Living in a meme paradise
We're just meme and simple guys
Living in a meme paradise
There's no time for deep thoughts and vice
Living in a meme paradise
We don't think, we all just meme nice
Living in a meme paradise

[Verse 3]
Hitchin' up the meme wagon, generating lots of laughs
Posted a meme on Monday, soon I'll post another batch
Think you're really funny? Think you're witty and smart?
Well, I know I'm a million times as memey as thou art
I'm the meme lord that the newbies wanna be like
On my keyboard day and night, scoring likes for the meme life
So don't be salty and don't be whiny
Or else, my brother, I might have to get memey on your behind
[Chorus]
We been spending most our lives
Living in a meme paradise
We're all crazy memers
Living in a meme paradise
There's no logic and no reason
Living in a meme paradise
But you'd probably think it's lame
Living in a meme paradise

[Outro]
(Ooh, ooh, lol!)
