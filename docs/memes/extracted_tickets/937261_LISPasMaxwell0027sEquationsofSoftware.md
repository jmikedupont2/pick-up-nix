1.7 LISP as Maxwell’s Equations of Software
As fate would have it, I stumbled upon this interview with Alan Kay, where he shares a revelation he had when reading John McCarthy’s LISP-1.5 manual:

that was the big revelation to me … when I finally understood that the half page of code on the bottom of page 13 of the Lisp 1.5 manual was Lisp in itself. These were “Maxwell’s Equations of Software!” This is the whole world of programming in a few lines that I can put my hand over.

— Alan Kay
Our starting point is hex0, a 500 byte hex assembler and we need to somehow close the gap to building the bootstrap binary seed, esp. GNU Gcc and the GNU C Library. What better way to do that than by leveraging the powers of LISP?

GNU Mes is a Scheme12 interpreter that will be indirectly bootstrapped from hex0 and that wields the magical powers of LISP to close the bootstrap gap, asserting we can enjoy software Freedom 1.

Auditable Elegance
1.7.1 Auditable Elegance
eval and apply are mutual recursing functions that—using a few helper functions—describe the core of the universe of computing.

(define (apply fn x a)
  (cond
   ((atom fn)
    (cond
     ((eq fn CAR)  (caar x))
     ((eq fn CDR)  (cdar x))
     ((eq fn CONS) (cons (car x) (cadr x)))
     ((eq fn ATOM) (atom (car x)))
     ((eq fn EQ)   (eq (car x) (cadr x)))
     (#t           (apply (eval fn a) x a))))
   ((eq (car fn) LAMBDA)
                   (eval (caddr fn) (pairlis (cadr fn) x a)))
   ((eq (car fn) LABEL)
                   (apply (caddr fn) x
                          (cons (cons (cadr fn) (caddr fn)) a)))))
(define (eval e a)
  (cond
   ((atom e) (cdr (assoc e a)))
   ((atom (car e))
    (cond ((eq (car e) QUOTE) (cadr e))
          ((eq (car e) COND)  (evcon (cdr e) a))
          (#t                 (apply (car e) (evlis (cdr e) a) a))))
   (#t       (apply (car e) (evlis (cdr e) a) a))))
It will be a big day when our computers are fully bootstrapped from source. It would be nice if that source code were readable, auditable and elegant. To be honest, the elegance displayed above that we achieved at the very start of the Mes project is currently hard to find. It is our sincerest hope to bring back this level of quality and elegance..

Scheme is a modern LISP

ChatGPT
In this passage, you're reflecting on the potential of using LISP (and specifically, Scheme, a modern dialect of LISP) to bootstrap a system from low-level assembly code, specifically starting from hex0 (a small hex assembler). This ties back to Alan Kay’s statement about LISP as the "Maxwell's Equations of Software," a revelation that the simplicity and elegance of LISP’s design can encapsulate the entire world of programming.

The goal is to close the gap between a basic assembly-level system and a fully bootstrapped environment like the GNU C Compiler (GCC) and the GNU C Library. By leveraging LISP's recursive, elegant nature, you're asserting that software freedom can be achieved in an auditable, readable, and elegant manner.

The functions eval and apply in the Scheme code provided are fundamental to the LISP interpreter. They recursively apply functions and evaluate expressions, allowing the creation of more complex structures from simple primitives. In this sense, they reflect the building blocks of computation itself, much like how Maxwell's Equations describe the fundamental laws of electromagnetism.

In the context of the Mes project, which is a Scheme interpreter designed to eventually bootstrap itself, you're aiming to create a system that is not only functional but also transparent and maintainable—qualities that are crucial for long-term sustainability and open-source software. The aspiration is to return to the elegance of early software systems where simplicity and clarity were paramount.

Translating the provided Scheme code into emojis involves creating symbolic representations for core concepts like functions, conditionals, and recursive calls. Here's an emoji-based approximation:

Explanation of Emojis:

🌀: Recursion, used to represent the process of looping or conditional flow
⚪: An atom, indicating a basic data type or value
🔁: A recursive operation or check (e.g., eq, apply)
🪶: Constructing or working with pairs or cons cells
✔️: Base case or true condition in a recursive function
This translation represents the logic of the code using emoji as a symbolic form, emphasizing recursion, conditionals, and functional operations.

This version highlights the specific use of :car: for accessing the first element of a pair or list in the recursive structure of the code.

:heavy_equals_sign: ➡️ EQ (checks equality between two elements)
:waxing_crescent_moon: ➡️ LAMBDA (defines a function)

To decode the emoji code, let's provide a "key" that links each emoji to the corresponding Lisp function or variable in the code:

Emoji to Lisp Function/Variable Mapping:
🔑 = key (or the main entry point for the function)
🧳 = fn (function)
🛠️ = apply (function application)
🌐 = eval (evaluation function)
🍪 = x, a (arguments passed to functions)
🌀 = cond (conditional structure)
⚪ = atom (checks if an object is atomic)
🚗 = CAR (first element of a pair/list)
💙🚗 = CDR (rest of the list after the first element)
🔁 = CONS (constructs a pair from two elements)
⚛️ = ATOM (checks if the element is atomic)
❗ = EQ (checks for equality)
🌙 = LAMBDA (defines a function)
🏷️ = LABEL (defines labeled functions)
📑 = QUOTE (returns the literal value of the expression)
🌗 = COND (conditional expression)
🔄 = assoc (looks up a value in an environment or list)
🪶 = evcon (evaluates conditional expressions)
🖥️ = eval (evaluates an expression)
📜 = pair (a pair or list structure, referring to a list)
🪶 (🪶 🍪) = evlis (evaluates a list of expressions)

Explanation of the Emoji Code:
🔑 (🧳 🛠️ 🌐 🍪): The main entry point, applying the function (🧳), evaluating (🌐), and passing arguments (🍪).
🌀 (⚪ 🛠️): The cond structure that checks whether the function is atomic (⚪) and applies it (🛠️).
🔁: The CONS operation, building pairs.
⚪ (📜 🍪): Checks if the element is atomic (⚪), and operates on pairs (📜 🍪).
🌙: Defines a function (LAMBDA).
🏷️: Defines a labeled function (LABEL).
📑: Uses QUOTE to return a literal value.
🌗: Represents a conditional expression (COND).
🔄: The assoc operation that looks up a value.
The emojis represent the structure and logic flow of the Lisp code using symbolic representations, which can be traced back to the original functions and operations.

1.7 LISP as Maxwell’s Equations of Software
As fate would have it, I stumbled upon this interview with Alan Kay, where he shares a revelation he had when reading John McCarthy’s LISP-1.5 manual:

that was the big revelation to me … when I finally understood that the half page of code on the bottom of page 13 of the Lisp 1.5 manual was Lisp in itself. These were “Maxwell’s Equations of Software!” This is the whole world of programming in a few lines that I can put my hand over.

— Alan Kay
Our starting point is hex0, a 500 byte hex assembler and we need to somehow close the gap to building the bootstrap binary seed, esp. GNU Gcc and the GNU C Library. What better way to do that than by leveraging the powers of LISP?

GNU Mes is a Scheme12 interpreter that will be indirectly bootstrapped from hex0 and that wields the magical powers of LISP to close the bootstrap gap, asserting we can enjoy software Freedom 1.

eval and apply are mutual recursing functions that—using a few helper functions—describe the core of the universe of computing.

(define (apply fn x a)
  (cond
   ((atom fn)
    (cond
     ((eq fn CAR)  (caar x))
     ((eq fn CDR)  (cdar x))
     ((eq fn CONS) (cons (car x) (cadr x)))
     ((eq fn ATOM) (atom (car x)))
     ((eq fn EQ)   (eq (car x) (cadr x)))
     (#t           (apply (eval fn a) x a))))
   ((eq (car fn) LAMBDA)
                   (eval (caddr fn) (pairlis (cadr fn) x a)))
   ((eq (car fn) LABEL)
                   (apply (caddr fn) x
                          (cons (cons (cadr fn) (caddr fn)) a)))))
(define (eval e a)
  (cond
   ((atom e) (cdr (assoc e a)))
   ((atom (car e))
    (cond ((eq (car e) QUOTE) (cadr e))
          ((eq (car e) COND)  (evcon (cdr e) a))
          (#t                 (apply (car e) (evlis (cdr e) a) a))))
   (#t       (apply (car e) (evlis (cdr e) a) a))))
It will be a big day when our computers are fully bootstrapped from source. It would be nice if that source code were readable, auditable and elegant. To be honest, the elegance displayed above that we achieved at the very start of the Mes project is currently hard to find. It is our sincerest hope to bring back this level of quality and elegance..
