Most successful tokens have a basic platform to trade and swap directly online, which is essential for building a strong ecosystem. My proposal is to create a DEX (Decentralized Exchange) for the SOLFUNMEME token. The DEX will allow users to swap tokens securely through a simple and user-friendly website.

Key Features:
Token Swap – Users can exchange SOLFUNMEME with other tokens directly online.
Web-Based Platform – A clean and easy-to-use interface, accessible on mobile and desktop.
Decentralized and Secure – Fully non-custodial, with smart contracts ensuring trustless and transparent swaps.
This DEX would make it easier for the community to trade SOLFUNMEME and grow its utility. 

I believe a DEX platform is essential and serves as a foundation for many innovative ideas we can build upon. That's why I’m aiming to start by creating a DEX platform for the SOLFUNMEME token. It’s a basic yet crucial step to help the token ecosystem grow organically.
