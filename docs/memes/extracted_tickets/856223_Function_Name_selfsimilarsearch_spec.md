**Function Name:** self_similar_search

**Description:** Reads a JSON file, hashes the keys and values, and finds where keys and values collide using simple hashing, fuzzy matching, and neural network (NN) vectorization.

**Input:**

* `json_file_path`: The path to the JSON file to be read.
* `hash_algorithms`: A list of hash algorithms to be used for simple hashing. For example, ["sha1", "md5", "crc32"].
* `fuzzy_matching_algorithm`: The algorithm to be used for fuzzy matching. For example, "levenshtein" or "jaro-winkler".
* `nn_vectorization`: The neural network architecture to be used for vectorization. For example, "word2vec" or "doc2vec".

**Output:**

* A JSON object containing the collisions found using each of the specified algorithms.
* The output JSON object will have the following structure:
```

  "simple_hashing": {
    "collisions": [
      {
        "key": "key1",
        "value": "value1",
        "hash": "hash1"
      },
      {
        "key": "key2",
        "value": "value2",
        "hash": "hash1"
      }
    ]
  },

    "collisions": [
      {

        "value": "value1",
        "distance": 0.5
      },
      {
        "key": "key2",
        "value": "value2",
        "distance": 0.5
      }
    ]
  },
  "nn_vectorization": {
    "collisions": [
      {
        "key": "key1",
        "value": "value1",
        "vector": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]
      },
      {
        "key": "key2",
        "value": "value2",
        "vector": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
**Implementations:**

Please provide implementations in the following programming languages:

1. OCaml
2. Rust
3. Haskell
4. C++

**Implementation Details:**

* For simple hashing, use the specified hash algorithms to hash each key and value in the input JSON file. Compare the hashes to find collisions.
* For fuzzy matching, use the specified algorithm to compare each key and value in the input JSON file. Calculate the distance between each pair of keys and values, and consider them to be collisions if the distance is below a certain threshold.
* For NN vectorization, use the specified neural network architecture to vectorize each key and value in the input JSON file. Compare the vectors to find collisions.
