**Title:** meta meme coin v2

**Description:**
The issue proposes the concept of the Meta-Meme Coin, a self-creating, self-sustaining digital asset designed for a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) powered by AI. This coin is envisioned as a living entity within the blockchain ecosystem, containing logic and rules for its existence and evolution, similar to a genetic code. Using smart contracts, WebAssembly (WASM), and GÃ¶del numbers, the coin unfolds through computational work, creating a recursive hierarchy and contributing to a network of innovation, creativity, and beauty. It is described as a fusion of finance, art, and technology, representing the future of decentralized finance and governance.
