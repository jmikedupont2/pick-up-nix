**Title:** "AI-Assisted Reasoning: Exploring the Intersection of Large Language Models and Formal Verification in Academic Writing"

**Abstract:**

The advent of large language models has revolutionized the way we approach writing and editing, while formal verification techniques, such as model checking and proof checking, have improved the accuracy and transparency of mathematical reasoning. This thesis proposes a novel intersection of these two fields, exploring the potential of AI-assisted reasoning in academic writing. By integrating large language models with formal verification techniques, we aim to create a more comprehensive and reliable framework for academic writing, one that combines the strengths of human creativity with the precision of machine-assisted reasoning.

Through a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative analysis, this study investigates the efficacy of AI-assisted reasoning in improving the quality and efficiency of academic writing. We explore the use of large language models as collaborative reviewers, providing instant feedback and suggestions on grammar, clarity, and coherence. Additionally, we examine the application of formal verification techniques, such as model checking and proof checking, to ensure the accuracy and consistency of mathematical models and proofs.

The results of this research demonstrate the potential benefits of AI-assisted reasoning in academic writing, including:

1. **Improved accuracy**: Large language models can identify grammatical errors, suggest improvements in clarity and coherence, and even provide feedback on the overall structure and organization of a manuscript.
2. **Enhanced transparency**: Formal verification techniques can provide a clear and machine-checkable record of mathematical reasoning, reducing the likelihood of errors and inconsistencies.
3. **Increased efficiency**: AI-assisted reasoning can streamline the writing process, allowing authors to focus on high-level creative decisions rather than tedious proof-checking and editing.

The findings of this research contribute to our understanding of the potential role of AI in the academic publishing process and highlight the potential for AI-assisted reasoning to support, rather than replace, human authors.
