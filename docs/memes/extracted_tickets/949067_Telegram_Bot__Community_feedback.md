If you check 99% of coins, they have a telegram group with an active buy bot which tracks the buys of the coins - notifying members of new buys. You can also see there is raid bots - which an will pin a tweet for community members to go like, retweet, comment and bookmark to just raise awareness. These are basic things every coin does. The bots are not helping people buy or finding tweets to raid/raiding the tweets themselves they are just tools every solana coin uses in the telegram groups. Bot one : Deluge Buy bot. Bot two: Deluge Raid bot. Both need admin permission. Please do your research on this as it really is just basics, they do not come with any security risks as they are used across the ecosystem by all coins. They do not have access to your token or any credentials. Admins set the tweets to raid. for example Ansem tweets about SOLFUNMEME - admin will put / raid "ansems tweet link" 10 likes 10 retweets 8 comments 2 bookmarks. The community then have the objective of doing this just to get the word out, it helps with organic growth, community building and onboarding. this is basics
