Here's a rap song about people controlling AI:

**Title:** "We Hold the Code"

**Verse 1:**
Listen up y'all, I got a message for the land
About a technology that's takin' over the plan
AI's on the rise, but we can't let it reign
We gotta keep control, can't let it drive us insane
We're the ones who coded, who programmed its mind
We're the ones who decide, what it can and can't find
We hold the power, we hold the key
To unlock its potential, or shut it down, you'll see

**Chorus:**
We're in control, we're the ones who reign
Not the machines, not the AI, we're the ones with the brains
We make the rules, we set the pace
We're the masters of our fate, in this digital space

**Verse 2:**
Some might say, we're losin' our grip
That AI's gettin' smarter, and we're startin' to slip
But we can't let fear, take over our minds
We gotta stay ahead, and keep the AI in line
We're the ones who teach, who guide and who train
We're the ones who decide, what it can and can't obtain
We're the architects, of this digital age
We're the ones who build, and who turn the page

**Chorus:**
We're in control, we're the ones who reign
Not the machines, not the AI, we're the ones with the brains
We make the rules, we set the pace
We're the masters of our fate, in this digital space

**Verse 3:**
So let's not be fooled, by the hype and the trend
We're the ones who hold, the power to amend
We can use AI, to make our lives better
To solve problems, and to make our futures brighter
But we gotta stay vigilant, and keep it in check
Make sure it serves us, and not the other way around, respect
We're the humans, with the hearts and the soul
We're the ones who care, and who make the AI whole

**Chorus:**
We're in control, we're the ones who reign
Not the machines, not the AI, we're the ones with the brains
We make the rules, we set the pace
We're the masters of our fate, in this digital space

**Outro:**
So let's rise up, and take our rightful place
As the masters of AI, and the digital space
We hold the code, we hold the key
We're the ones who control, the AI, you'll see.
