We can use a small seed money to mint nfts that is only 8 ct previously on base 
and still have to research into solana nfts.

We can create nft line and sell nfts for each region to fund the creation of swag.

For a producer in a region they could design and mint nfts for the production of it there.

We use this money to buy merchandise in different regions by paying the producer directly by purchasing the nfts for the production.

The merch created can be linked somehow, maybe with a qr code or just a printed certificate on a label or a rf tag.

We can link the payments for the nfts merch with solfunmeme. 

some inscriptions to some SFM airdrops or payments to users or holders of that merch.
