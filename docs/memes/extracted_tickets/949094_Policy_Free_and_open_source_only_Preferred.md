Our goal is the rewriting the entire system in the meta-meme http://meta-introspector.github.io/meta-meme/, and for this purpose we need to have the source code so we can study and change it.
that is why we only want to use free and open source code and be self hosted and sovereign like in the project idea fro the printint press 
https://gitlab.com/jmikedupont2/theprintingpress 

for this reason we want to make sure all software is selected based on its qualities and we might have to use non free services like discord and telegram and twitter/x for interacting but we want to make sure that as much as we can we self host and also offer these services to our customers for customization.
