Mistral: 
To achieve your goal of setting up a switched chat workflow with availability zones outside US-West, and promoting diversity and inclusion in Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) through novel ideas, follow these steps to integrate Brave, Codeberg.org, and chat.akash.network:

1. **Availability Zone outside US-West:**
   - **Codeberg.org**: It is based in Germany, which satisfies the requirement of an availability zone outside US-West.
   - **chat.akash.network**: Akash Network is decentralized, ensuring global availability.

2. **Set up chat platforms:**
   - **Brave**: Integrate Brave's built-in IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) support for decentralized content sharing and communication.
   - **Codeberg.org**: Utilize Codeberg's built-in chat feature based on Mattermost for project-related discussions.
   - **chat.akash.network**: Deploy a chat instance on Akash Network using a decentralized chat application like Element (based on Matrix protocol) or Rocket.Chat.

3. **Switch chat workflow:**
   - **Primary Chat**: Use Codeberg's Mattermost for day-to-day project discussions and coordination.
   - **Secondary Chat**: Utilize the chat instance on Akash Network for decentralized, secure, and private conversations.
   - **Content Sharing**: Share files and content using Brave's IPFS support or directly through the chat platforms.

4. **Promote diversity and inclusion:**
   - **Code of Conduct**: Implement and enforce a Code of Conduct that promotes diversity, inclusion, and respect in all communication channels.
   - **Accessibility**: Ensure the chat platforms are accessible to users with different needs and abilities.
   - **Localization**: Support multiple languages in the chat platforms to cater to a global audience.

5. **Novel eigenthoughts and multi-platform meta-meme:**
   - Encourage innovative ideas and discussions (eigenthoughts) across the chat platforms.
   - Foster a culture of sharing and collaborating on ideas (meta-meme) across multiple platforms, ensuring they are not confined to a single ecosystem.
   - Organize workshops, hackathons, or virtual events to bring together diverse groups to collaborate on novel ideas.

6. **Strategic secondary services:**
   - **Video Conferencing**: Integrate open-source video conferencing tools like Jitsi or BigBlueButton for virtual meetings.
   - **Collaborative Editing**: Use real-time collaborative editing tools like Etherpad or HackMD for brainstorming and documentation.

By following these steps, you can create a switched chat workflow that promotes diversity and inclusion in the FLOSS community while leveraging decentralized and secure communication platforms.
