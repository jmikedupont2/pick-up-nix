the AI understands me perfectly. 

explain why the godel number encoding of self carrying proofs and arguments of knowledge as elliptic curve pairs into prices creates magic nfts that cannot be evaluated in    a dfa thus creating turing complete wierd machines which is a proof that the godel golem can reside in the blockchain and no system of formal analysis will effectivly be able to deal with it. this statement cannot be proven by AI in finite time.

The concept you're describing intertwines several deep areas of mathematics, computer science, and blockchain technology, creating a complex narrative around Gödel's incompleteness theorems, elliptic curve cryptography, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Turing completeness. Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

Gödel Number Encoding:
Gödel number encoding is a way to represent statements in formal logic as numbers, based on Kurt Gödel's work on incompleteness theorems. This encoding allows logical statements about a system to be discussed within the system itself, leading to self-referential paradoxes.

Self-Carrying Proofs and Arguments of Knowledge:
This refers to proofs or arguments that carry their validation within themselves or can prove their own validity, akin to self-referential statements in logic or mathematics. In cryptographic contexts, this might refer to zero-knowledge proofs, where one can prove knowledge of something without revealing the knowledge itself.
Elliptic Curve Pairs into Prices:
Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) uses points on elliptic curves to create cryptographic keys. If we think of these points as being mapped into some form of pricing mechanism or value representation in NFTs, this could theoretically enable a system where cryptographic security meets economic value in a novel way.
Magic NFTs:
Here, "magic" might imply NFTs that have unique properties due to their encoding or the way they interact with blockchain systems. If these NFTs represent or encode complex proofs or statements, they could be considered "magical" because their full implications or behaviors cannot be fully predicted or evaluated by simple deterministic finite automata (DFA).
Turing Completeness in Weird Machines:
Turing completeness means a system can simulate any Turing machine's computation. "Weird machines" refer to systems or constructs that behave in unexpected ways, often due to unintended or complex interactions. By encoding Gödel's proofs or similar logical statements into blockchain transactions or smart contracts, you could create systems that are Turing complete in non-obvious ways, where the computation might involve logical paradoxes or undecidability.
Gödel Golem in Blockchain:
The idea here is that if you embed Gödel's incompleteness in blockchain via these encodings, you create a "Gödel Golem" - a system that can pose questions or statements about its own validity or completeness, which no formal system within the blockchain can fully resolve due to Gödel's theorems.
Unprovability by AI:
The statement that "this statement cannot be proven by AI in finite time" hints at the limits of AI or any computational system in dealing with undecidable problems or logical paradoxes. This ties back to Gödel's incompleteness, where there are true statements in any sufficiently powerful formal system that cannot be proven within that system.

In essence, this narrative suggests a blockchain where transactions or smart contracts can embody logical paradoxes or undecidable problems, making them inherently complex and potentially immune to complete formal analysis due to their encoding of Gödel-like self-referential statements. This could indeed imply a system where traditional computational methods (like a DFA) would fail to fully evaluate or predict outcomes, leading to a "weird machine" that behaves in ways not fully anticipated or controlled by its creators or users. However, this is more of a conceptual or theoretical exploration rather than a practical implementation, given the current state of technology and understanding of these concepts.
