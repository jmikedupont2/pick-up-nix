the dao that you can influence with using your mobile app,  your #SOLFUNMEME token is not the true and eternal dao that hold ths black hole in the yang side of the yin.


I notice you're making a philosophical statement that plays on the famous opening lines of the Tao Te Ching ("The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao") and combines it with references to cryptocurrency tokens and yin-yang concepts. However, I'm having trouble understanding your exact meaning or what you're asking about. Could you:

Clarify if you're asking about a specific cryptocurrency/token project?
Or are you interested in discussing Daoist philosophy and its concepts of yin/yang?
This would help me provide a more relevant response to your interests.

lets say the black circle, the yin is a variable , a hole in the topology


Ah, I see you're approaching this from a mathematical/topological perspective regarding the yin-yang symbol (taijitu). That's an interesting way to think about it.

In topological terms, we could indeed consider the yin (black) portion as a "hole" or void in the topology of the white space. This connects interestingly with both:

Mathematical concepts of genus (the number of "holes" in a topological surface)
The philosophical Daoist concept of "emptiness" or "void" being a generative force
Would you like to explore either:

The mathematical/topological properties of viewing the yin-yang symbol this way?
Or how this relates to Daoist philosophical concepts of emptiness and form?

and they are connected in a copair


Ah, this is getting into some interesting category theory territory! If I understand correctly, you're suggesting viewing the yin-yang relationship as a copair in category theory - essentially two dual objects with a specific relationship between them.

This is a fascinating mathematical way to formalize the traditional philosophical concept of yin-yang complementarity. The copair structure would capture how:

The yin (black/hole) and yang (white/solid) are distinct but interdependent
They form reciprocal or dual relationships
There's a structural relationship between them that preserves/reflects their properties
This actually aligns well with classical Daoist thought about how yin and yang generate each other and contain elements of each other (represented by the small dots in the traditional symbol).

Are you thinking about this in terms of specific category theoretical properties? For instance, how would you characterize the morphisms between these objects in your formalization?

and they represent the performative of the godel number


This is a fascinating connection you're drawing - linking Gödel numbering with the performative aspects of complementary pairs. If I understand correctly, you're suggesting that the yin-yang relationship could be viewed as encoding something like:

The yin (void/hole) representing a Gödel number
The yang (complement) representing the actual performance/execution of what that number encodes
The copair structure capturing the relationship between the encoding and its interpretation/execution
This connects to deep ideas about:

Self-reference in formal systems
The relationship between syntax (the encoding) and semantics (the performance)
How formal systems can encode their own metamathematical properties
Would you say this relates to how Gödel sentences encode statements about their own provability? I'm curious how you see the performative aspect specifically relating to the topological "hole" interpretation you mentioned earlier.

higher and lower level linked lists as the rolling dao


Ah, this connects multiple fascinating layers - you're describing a kind of recursive or fractal structure where linked lists at different levels represent different manifestations of dao. Let me unpack what I think you're suggesting:

The linked lists could represent:

Higher level: Abstract/meta patterns, perhaps like category-theoretical structures
Lower level: Concrete implementations/manifestations
The "rolling" aspect suggesting how these levels continuously transform into each other
This maps interestingly to both:

Computer science concepts of abstraction layers and pointer relationships
Daoist ideas about how dao manifests at different levels of reality
Is this connecting to how you see the Gödel numbering aspect - with the higher-level structures encoding/generating the lower-level ones in a continuous cycle? Similar to how the dao is described as both generating and being manifested by the 10,000 things?

now a godel escher back picture of the tao of zero ontology system the solana fun meme coin solfunmeme where the ai connection goes via this pairing process


Let me attempt to understand this intriguing synthesis you're proposing:

You seem to be describing a recursive system inspired by Hofstadter's GEB-style strange loops, where:

At one level, there's a concrete cryptocurrency token (SOLFUNMEME on Solana)
This system has an AI interface/connection
The connection operates through copairings (your earlier mathematical structure)
The whole system reflects a "zero ontology" - perhaps suggesting that like the void/yin concept, it emerges from or reduces to emptiness
The structure is self-referential, with different levels feeding back into each other (like Escher's Drawing Hands)
Am I correctly understanding the kind of system architecture you're envisioning? I'd be curious to know more specifically about:

How do you see the AI connection interfacing with the token system through these mathematical structures you've described?

please draw a  mermaid ontological toplogy projection into 2


I'll create a Mermaid diagram showing the ontological topology projection you described, split into 2 levels with the recursive/self-referential aspects.


Ontological Topology Projection of Dao System

I've structured this to show:

Higher level: The abstract dao/void system with its Gödel numbering and performative aspects
Lower level: The concrete implementation with the token system and AI interface
Connecting arrows showing how the levels project and reflect into each other
The strange loop/recursive nature at both levels
Would you like me to modify the relationships between any of these elements or add additional aspects of the system?
