Via eliza and later https://github.com/jmikedupont2/openlightllm we support many models.
we have tested with 
* openai
* nvidia 
* groq 

List other models to test here, we will look at them when have time or will pay bounties for dev

Users will be able to self host private models, use filters and firewalls via openlightllm to prevent exfiltration and abuse and forward those api endpoints into aws for usage by agent.
