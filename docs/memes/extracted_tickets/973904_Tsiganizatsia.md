🌪️ **Paxos Meme Consensus**: A decentralized, community-driven process that ensures only the most captivating, engaging content survives and thrives.
🚀 **Hyper-Pump Propagation**: A mechanism that magnifies memes through recursive hype cycles, continuously expanding their reach and influence.
⚡ **Semantic Compression**: Packing maximum punch into minimal form—memes are distilled into pure, viral essence, optimized for rapid consumption and adoption.
