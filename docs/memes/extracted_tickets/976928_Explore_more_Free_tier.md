Right now we have to scoop up the free tiers, i used up my nvidia free tier, if all our users sign up and get 5000 credits to use for the project and we have 1000 users then thats a lot of free credits. lets work as a team to sign up as many free tiers as we can and document them.  look at https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev and this https://github.com/rajannpatel/Pi-Hole-PiVPN-on-Google-Compute-Engine-Free-Tier-with-Full-Tunnel-and-Split-Tunnel-OpenVPN-Configs we need to work on making it easy to support multiple free tiers and migrate seamlessly between them, also aws spot instances are awsome.
