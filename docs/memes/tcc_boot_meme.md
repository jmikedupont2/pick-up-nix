# The `tcc-boot` Meme

This meme represents "a patched version of TinyCC" used in the GNU Mes bootstrap process, as described in the `BOOTSTRAP` document. `tcc-boot` serves as an intermediate C compiler, bridging the gap between the minimal MesCC and a full-fledged GCC.

## Meme Aspects:
- **The Stepping Stone**: The role of an intermediate compiler in a multi-stage bootstrap, gradually increasing capabilities.
- **Pragmatic Compromise**: Using an existing, small C compiler (TinyCC) to facilitate the bootstrap, rather than building everything from scratch immediately.
- **The Bridge**: Connecting the minimal bootstrap environment to the broader world of C compilation.

## Key Elements:
- **Concept**: Patched TinyCC for bootstrap.
- **Role**: An important stage in the GNU Mes bootstrap, contributing to the "Maxwell's Equation of Software" by providing a practical path to a fully bootstrapped system.
