# The `Full Source Bootstrapping` Meme

This meme encapsulates the ambitious and fundamental concept of building a complete software system from its absolute minimal source code, without relying on pre-compiled binaries. As described in the GNU Mes `BOOTSTRAP` document, it's the ultimate quest for software freedom and verifiability, akin to deriving all of physics from first principles.

## Meme Aspects:
- **The Genesis Story**: It's the origin myth of a software system, starting from a tiny, auditable seed (`hex.0`) and progressively building more complex tools.
- **Trust No Binary**: The inherent distrust of opaque binary blobs, emphasizing the need to build everything from human-readable source.
- **The Infinite Loop (in a good way)**: The idea of a self-hosting compiler that can compile itself, proving its own existence and integrity.
- **The "Why" of Software Freedom**: It's not just about building, but about understanding and controlling every layer of the software stack.

## Key Elements:
- **Concept**: Building software from minimal, verifiable source.
- **Core Components**: `hex.0`, `hex.1`, `M0`, `M1`, `hex2`, `M2-Planet`, `GNU Mes`, `MesCC`, `tcc-boot`.
- **Goal**: Software freedom, reproducibility, and verifiability.
- **Connection to Maxwell's Equations**: This process is the practical embodiment of the "Maxwell's Equation of Software" meme, demonstrating the fundamental laws of computation through self-bootstrapping.
