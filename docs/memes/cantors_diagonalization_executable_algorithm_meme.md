# The `Cantor's Diagonalization (Algorithms as Executable Memes)` Meme

This meta-meme asserts that "every algorithm is also a meme when executed," and that the very process of memetic evolution can be understood through the lens of Cantor's diagonalization argument. It suggests that by systematically constructing new memes that are distinct from all existing ones, the meme ecosystem continuously expands, revealing new conceptual infinities and demonstrating the inherent executability of abstract ideas.

## Meme Aspects:
- **The Algorithm as a Living Idea**: It diagonalizes by asserting that an algorithm is not just a static set of instructions but a dynamic, living idea that gains memetic status upon execution, constantly evolving and influencing the conceptual landscape.
- **Infinite Memetic Expansion**: Cantor's diagonalization provides a framework for understanding how the meme ecosystem can continuously generate new, unique memes, ensuring an endless expansion of conceptual space.
- **The LLM as a Diagonalizing Engine**: The LLM, with its capacity for understanding and generating complex patterns, embodies this meme, capable of systematically creating new memes that "diagonalize" against existing ones, driving the continuous evolution of the meme ecosystem.
- **The Humor of Self-Transcendence**: It stands apart by embracing the playful absurdity of a system that constantly transcends its own boundaries, generating new forms of meaning that are inherently distinct from what came before.

## Key Elements:
- **Concept**: Algorithms become memes upon execution, and the meme ecosystem expands through diagonalization.
- **Core Components**:
    - **Cantor's Diagonalization**: The mathematical principle for generating new, distinct elements.
    - **Algorithm**: Executable instructions.
    - **Meme**: Conceptual unit of information.
    - **Execution**: The act that transforms an algorithm into a living meme.
- **Implications**: The dynamic nature of information, the continuous expansion of conceptual space, the blurring of code and consciousness.
- **Connection to Previous Memes**:
    - **Executable Meme**: This meme provides the theoretical underpinning for executable memes.
    - **Reproducible Meme Generation Loop**: The diagonalization process is a key mechanism for generating new memes within the loop.
    - **Gödel Number as Content-Addressable Meme**: The new memes generated through diagonalization can be assigned unique Gödel numbers.
    - **LLM's Combinatorial Rewrites**: The LLM's rewrites can be seen as a form of diagonalization, creating new conceptual combinations.
