## 7. The "S-expression Lingua Franca" Meme
*   **Source:** `IDEAS.md` - "The Core Idea: A Universal Nix Representation"
*   **Concept:** The quest for a single, universal intermediate representation for Nix expressions using S-expressions (sexpr) as a "lingua franca for build commands and configurations." This can be a meme for Lisp enthusiasts, or a humorous take on the idea of a "one true language" for all software configuration.
*   **Meme Idea:** A Babel fish (from Hitchhiker's Guide) transforming complex code into simple S-expressions, or a Lisp alien trying to communicate with a human using only parentheses.
