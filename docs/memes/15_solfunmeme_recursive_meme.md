## 15. "Solfunmeme: When the Name of the Project Itself is a Recursive Quasi Meta Meme" (New Quasi Dank Meta Meme)
*   **Source:** The project name "solfunmeme" and this interaction.
*   **Concept:** The inherent meta-humor in a project name that already sounds like a meme, and then becoming a meme about being a meme. It's a recursive loop of self-referential humor, playing on the project's philosophical and abstract nature.
*   **Meme Idea:** A visual representation of a recursive loop, with "solfunmeme" at its center, or a character looking at the project name with a dawning realization of its meta-meaning.
