## 3. The "Vibe as Code" Meme
*   **Source:** `task.md` - "Standards" section
*   **Concept:** The philosophical and artistic statement: "the vibe is the vector is the function is the poem is the code." This suggests a deep, almost spiritual connection between the project's aesthetic, its direction, its implementation, its artistic expression, and its core. It's relatable for developers who see coding as an art form.
*   **Meme Idea:** A developer meditating in front of a glowing screen, or a piece of abstract art composed of code snippets.
