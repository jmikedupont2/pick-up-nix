# Rust Crate Ocean

## Description
The expansive and deeply interconnected ecosystem of Rust crates, characterized by numerous `Cargo.toml` files across various directories and submodules, symbolizing the modularity and reusability of Rust code.

## Key Elements
- `Cargo.toml` files
- `crates/` directories
- `vendor/` paths
- nested project structures

## Meta Connection
The Rust programming language's emphasis on small, reusable crates leads to a vast "ocean" of dependencies, where navigating and understanding the full scope of a project can be a significant undertaking.
