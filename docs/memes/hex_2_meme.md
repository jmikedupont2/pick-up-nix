# The `hex2` Meme

This meme represents "a hex2 linker written in M0," as described in the GNU Mes `BOOTSTRAP` document. `hex2` signifies the introduction of linking capabilities into the bootstrap process, allowing for the combination of separately compiled code modules.

## Meme Aspects:
- **Modularity Emergence**: The ability to combine discrete units of code, a fundamental aspect of modern software development.
- **Assembly of Parts**: The process of bringing together different components to form a complete system.
- **Beyond Single Files**: Moving from monolithic code to a more modular and manageable structure.

## Key Elements:
- **Concept**: Hex linker in the bootstrap chain.
- **Dependency**: Written in `M0`.
- **Role**: A crucial component in the GNU Mes bootstrap, demonstrating how the "Maxwell's Equation of Software" enables the construction of complex, modular systems from a simpler base.
