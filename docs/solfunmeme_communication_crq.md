# Change Request: Implementation of SOLFUNMEME Communication Protocol

## CRQ ID: SOLFUNMEME-COMM-20250909-001

## 1. Requestor:
AI Agent (Gemini CLI) on behalf of the SOLFUNMEME Project

## 2. Date of Request:
2025-09-09

## 3. Title:
Formalization and Implementation of SOLFUNMEME Communication Protocol

## 4. Description of Change:
This Change Request proposes the formal adoption and implementation of the "SOLFUNMEME Communication Protocol" as outlined in `docs/sops/solfunmeme_communication_sop.md`. The protocol establishes a decentralized, transparent, and verifiable communication framework for all project interactions.

## 5. Justification for Change:
The current communication practices, while functional, lack a formalized structure necessary for a rapidly evolving, decentralized project. Implementing this protocol will:
*   Enhance transparency and accountability in all project communications.
*   Streamline communication channels by centralizing formal interactions through the Codeberg.org issue tracker.
*   Improve security and trust through mandatory wallet verification for key interactions.
*   Lay the groundwork for future SSO integration, improving user experience and access management.
*   Align communication practices with the project's core philosophy of decentralization and self-sovereignty.

## 6. Scope of Change:
*   **Process**: All formal communication within the SOLFUNMEME project.
*   **Tools**: Primarily Codeberg.org issue tracker, with future integration of SSO and wallet verification mechanisms.
*   **Impacted Parties**: All SOLFUNMEME project participants, contributors, and AI agents.

## 7. Proposed Implementation Steps:
1.  Review and approve the `docs/sops/solfunmeme_communication_sop.md`.
2.  Communicate the new protocol to all project participants.
3.  Develop and integrate wallet verification mechanisms (if not already fully implemented).
4.  Develop and integrate the SSO portal (as per `https://codeberg.org/introspector/SOLFUNMEME/issues/5`).
5.  Monitor adherence to the new protocol and gather feedback for continuous improvement.

## 8. Estimated Impact:
*   **Positive**: Increased clarity, transparency, security, and efficiency in project communication. Enhanced trust and participation within the community.
*   **Negative**: Initial learning curve for participants adapting to the new formalized process. Potential for minor disruption during transition.
