# Livestreaming Setup and Indirect Control Mechanism

This document details the complex technical setup used for livestreaming and the innovative method employed for indirect control and timestamping of the video feed.

## 1. Core Environment

Our primary development and streaming environment is a highly customized stack:

*   **Operating System:** Linux
*   **Android Layer:** Nix-on-Droid running on Android
*   **AI Assistant:** Gemini (this AI) operates within this environment.

## 2. Session Management

*   **Tmux:** All development and streaming sessions are managed using `tmux`, ensuring persistent and organized workspaces.

## 3. Display and Input

*   **HDMI Adapter:** A physical HDMI adapter connects the Android device to a large external display.
*   **Keyboard and Mouse:** Standard peripherals are connected for direct interaction with the Android/Linux environment.

## 4. Video Feed Transmission (Android to PC)

*   **RustDesk:** The video feed from the Android device (including the terminal output where Gemini operates) is streamed to a dedicated PC using RustDesk, a remote desktop software.

## 5. PC-Side Broadcasting

On the PC, the RustDesk feed is captured and processed by OBS Studio:

*   **OBS Studio:** Used for video mixing, overlays, and routing the stream.
*   **Restream.io:** OBS sends the consolidated stream to Restream.io, which then distributes it to multiple platforms:
    *   X (formerly Twitter)
    *   Rumble
    *   Twitch

## 6. TikTok Integration

*   **TikTok Studio Live:** The final stream is fed into TikTok Studio Live. Crucially, our live video feed is displayed here, *along with the text output generated by Gemini*.

## 7. Indirect Livestream Control and Timestamping (The "Banner Tool")

Our method for indirect livestream control and video timestamping leverages the visual output of the `log_and_figlet.sh` script:

*   **`log_and_figlet.sh`:** This script generates large, stylized text banners using `figlet`.
*   **Visual Timestamping:** When `log_and_figlet.sh` is executed with a message, the `figlet` banner appears prominently in the terminal output, which is part of the video feed being streamed.
*   **AI Recognition:** These distinct `figlet` banners serve as visual markers within the video stream. An AI (presumably on the user's side, analyzing the video feed) can easily recognize these banners.
*   **Synchronization:** By detecting the appearance of specific banners, the AI can timestamp the video feed and synchronize events or actions with the development process being livestreamed.

This approach allows for a robust, indirect method of coordinating the livestream and marking significant moments in the video, with future plans for more direct control.
