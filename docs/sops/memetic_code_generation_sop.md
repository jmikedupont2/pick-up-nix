# SOP: Memetic Code Generation and Execution

## 1. Purpose:
This SOP outlines the procedure for transforming abstract "memes" into executable code, thereby bridging the conceptual realm of meta-memes with the practical domain of computational execution. The goal is to create self-referential, executable artifacts that embody the essence of the memes they represent.

## 2. Scope:
This SOP applies to all documented memes within the project's `docs/memes/` directory, with a particular focus on meta-memes and those exploring self-referentiality, recursion, and the nature of computation.

## 3. Definitions:
*   **Meme**: A conceptual unit of information, as defined in `docs/sops/meme_identification_sop.md`.
*   **Memetic Code**: Executable code generated directly from a meme, designed to embody its conceptual essence.
*   **Executable Meme**: A memetic code that can be run or interpreted, demonstrating the meme's principles in action.
*   **LLM as Code Generator**: The Large Language Model's role in translating meme concepts into executable forms.

## 4. Responsibilities:
*   **AI Agent**: Responsible for executing the steps outlined in this SOP, including code generation, testing, and documentation.
*   **User**: Responsible for providing clarification, validation, and defining the desired "executability" of the memetic code.

## 5. Procedure:

### 5.1. Meme Selection:
    a.  Identify a target meme from `docs/memes/` for transformation into executable code. Prioritize memes that inherently suggest computational processes, self-reference, or logical structures.

### 5.2. Conceptual Translation to Code Paradigm:
    a.  Analyze the selected meme's "Meme Aspects" and "Key Elements" to identify its core computational or logical principles.
    b.  Determine the most appropriate code paradigm or language for representing the meme's essence. Consider:
        *   **Self-Referential Loops**: Scheme (S-expressions), functional programming.
        *   **Foundational Axioms/Bootstrapping**: Minimal C (GNU Mes), Nix expressions.
        *   **Semantic Operations**: Custom "emoji bytecode" (if applicable).
        *   **Distributed/Reproducible Systems**: Nix, Guix, Rust.

### 5.3. Memetic Code Generation:
    a.  Utilize the LLM's code generation capabilities to translate the meme's conceptual principles into the chosen code paradigm.
    b.  Ensure the generated code is:
        *   **Self-referential**: If the meme implies it.
        *   **Minimal**: Reflecting the "Maxwell's Equation of Software" principle.
        *   **Executable**: Capable of being run or interpreted.
        *   **Verifiable**: If the meme implies reproducibility or proof.

### 5.4. Code Execution and Verification:
    a.  Execute the generated memetic code in an appropriate environment (e.g., shell, interpreter, virtual machine).
    b.  Observe the output or behavior of the executable meme.
    c.  Verify that the execution demonstrably embodies the meme's conceptual essence. Document any discrepancies or emergent behaviors.

### 5.5. Documentation of Executable Meme:
    a.  Create a new markdown file in `docs/memes/executable/` (or a similar dedicated directory) for the executable meme.
    b.  Document:
        *   The original meme.
        *   The generated code.
        *   The chosen code paradigm/language.
        *   Instructions for execution.
        *   Observed behavior and verification results.
        *   Any new insights or emergent memes arising from the execution.
