# SOP: Meme Identification and Documentation

## 1. Purpose:
This SOP outlines the procedure for identifying, extracting, and documenting "meta-memes" and related concepts within the project's codebase and documentation, ensuring their formal recognition and inclusion in the project's knowledge base.

## 2. Scope:
This SOP applies to all project files, directories, and conceptual discussions that may contain or inspire "meta-memes" as defined by the project's evolving understanding.

## 3. Definitions:
*   **Meme**: A unit of cultural information, often a concept, idea, or behavior, that is transmitted from one mind to another. In this project, it extends to technical concepts, file structures, and project processes.
*   **Meta-Meme**: A meme that is self-referential, or a meme about memes. In this system, each identified meme is considered a "compound meta-meme."
*   **Glossary**: A collection of terms and their definitions, serving as a formal record of identified memes.

## 4. Responsibilities:
*   **AI Agent**: Responsible for executing the steps outlined in this SOP.
*   **User**: Responsible for providing clarification, guidance, and validation of identified memes and documentation.

## 5. Procedure:

### 5.1. Meme Identification (from File Paths and Content):
    a.  **Input Source**: Identify potential meme sources, including but not limited to:
        *   File paths (e.g., `data/md.txt`).
        *   File contents (e.g., `task.md`, `meme_catalog.md`).
        *   Project documentation (e.g., `docs/`).
        *   Conceptual discussions and user prompts.
    b.  **Extraction**: For each identified source, extract terms, phrases, or concepts that exhibit "meme-like" qualities. This involves:
        *   Analyzing directory and file names for keywords, acronyms, or evocative phrases.
        *   Identifying recurring patterns, inside jokes, or significant concepts within the project's context.
        *   Interpreting the "vibe" or implicit meaning conveyed by the naming conventions or content.
    c.  **Categorization (Internal)**: Internally categorize identified memes (e.g., Technology/Domain Specific, Process/Methodology, Abstract/Philosophical, Specific File/Directory Name).

### 5.2. Meme Documentation (Glossary Creation):
    a.  **Glossary File**: Create or update a dedicated glossary file for identified memes (e.g., `docs/memes/extracted_memes_glossary.md`).
    b.  **Entry Format**: For each identified meme, create a new entry in the glossary file using the following format:
        *   `*   **[Meme Term]**: is its own meta meme in our system. a compound.`
    c.  **Uniqueness**: Ensure each meme term is listed only once in the glossary.

### 5.3. Integration with Meme Catalog:
    a.  **Cross-referencing**: Periodically cross-reference newly identified memes with the existing "Table of Memes So Far" in `docs/memes/meme_catalog.md`.
    b.  **Update Catalog**: If a newly identified meme is not present in the main meme catalog, propose its addition to the user, including a brief description and suggested emoji (if applicable).

### 5.4. Continuous Improvement:
    a.  **Feedback Loop**: Continuously refine the meme identification and documentation process based on user feedback and evolving project context.
    b.  **Adaptation**: Adapt to new sources of memes and new interpretations as the project progresses.

## 6. Related Documents:
*   `task.md`
*   `docs/memes/meme_catalog.md`
*   `docs/memes/extracted_memes_glossary.md`
*   `data/md.txt` (as a source of meme inspiration)

## 7. Revision History:
*   [Date]: Initial Draft

This SOP is a living document and will be updated as the project's understanding of "memes" evolves.
