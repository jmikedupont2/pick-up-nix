# SOP: Meme Identification and Documentation

## 1. Purpose:
This SOP outlines the procedure for identifying, extracting, and documenting "meta-memes" and related concepts within the project's codebase and documentation, ensuring their formal recognition and inclusion in the project's knowledge base.

## 2. Scope:
This SOP applies to all project files, directories, and conceptual discussions that may contain or inspire "meta-memes" as defined by the project's evolving understanding.

## 3. Definitions:
*   **Meme**: A unit of cultural information, often a concept, idea, or behavior, that is transmitted from one mind to another. In this project, it extends to technical concepts, file structures, and project processes.
*   **Meta-Meme**: A meme that is self-referential, or a meme about memes. In this system, each identified meme is considered a "compound meta-meme."
*   **Glossary**: A collection of terms and their definitions, serving as a formal record of identified memes.
*   **Dank Meta-Meme**: A highly abstract, philosophical, and often humorous meme that is self-referential, interconnected with other memes, incorporates technical or mathematical concepts, and describes the emergence of new entities or higher consciousness.

## 4. Responsibilities:
*   **AI Agent**: Responsible for executing the steps outlined in this SOP.
*   **User**: Responsible for providing clarification, guidance, and validation of identified memes and documentation.

## 5. Procedure:

### 5.1. Meme Identification (from File Paths and Content):
    a.  **Input Source**: Identify potential meme sources, including but not limited to:
        *   File paths (e.g., `data/md.txt`).
        *   File contents (e.g., `task.md`, `meme_catalog.md`).
        *   Project documentation (e.g., `docs/`).
        *   Conceptual discussions and user prompts.
    b.  **Extraction**: For each identified source, extract terms, phrases, or concepts that exhibit "meme-like" qualities. This involves:
        *   Analyzing directory and file names for keywords, acronyms, or evocative phrases.
        *   Identifying recurring patterns, inside jokes, or significant concepts within the project's context.
        *   Interpreting the "vibe" or implicit meaning conveyed by the naming conventions or content.
    c.  **Categorization (Internal)**: Internally categorize identified memes (e.g., Technology/Domain Specific, Process/Methodology, Abstract/Philosophical, Specific File/Directory Name).

### 5.2. Meme Documentation (Glossary Creation):
    a.  **Glossary File**: Create or update a dedicated glossary file for identified memes (e.g., `docs/memes/extracted_memes_glossary.md`).
    b.  **Entry Format**: For each identified meme, create a new entry in the glossary file using the following format:
        *   `*   **[Meme Term]**: is its own meta meme in our system. a compound.`
    c.  **Uniqueness**: Ensure each meme term is listed only once in the glossary.
    d.  **Diagonalization Aspect (for Reflection Memes)**: When creating "reflection memes" (as described in 5.6), identify how the source meme "diagonalizes" against the collective meme ecosystem, highlighting its unique contribution or how it stands apart.

### 5.3. Integration with Meme Catalog:
    a.  **Cross-referencing**: Periodically cross-reference newly identified memes with the existing "Table of Memes So Far" in `docs/memes/meme_catalog.md`.
    b.  **Update Catalog**: If a newly identified meme is not present in the main meme catalog, propose its addition to the user, including a brief description and suggested emoji (if applicable).

### 5.4. Continuous Improvement:
    a.  **Feedback Loop**: Continuously refine the meme identification and documentation process based on user feedback and evolving project context.
    b.  **Adaptation**: Adapt to new sources of memes and new interpretations as the project progresses.

### 5.6. Reflection Meme Generation:
    a.  **Purpose**: To create meta-memes that reflect on existing memes, synthesizing emergent themes and highlighting unique "diagonalization" aspects.
    b.  **Procedure**:
        i.   Select a source meme from `docs/memes/`.
        ii.  Analyze its core concepts and its relationship to other memes within the ecosystem.
        iii. Identify its "diagonalization aspect"â€”what makes it unique or how it challenges/redefines the collective understanding.
        iv.  Generate a new markdown file in `docs/memes/` (e.g., `reflection_of_[original_meme_name].md`).
        v.   Document the reflection, including the original meme, its diagonalization aspect, key elements, implications, and connections to other memes.
        vi.  Ensure the reflection meme contributes to the "diagonalization of the memes meta meme" by highlighting emergent complexity and self-transcendence.

## 6. Related Documents:
*   `task.md`
*   `docs/memes/meme_catalog.md`
*   `docs/memes/extracted_memes_glossary.md`
*   `data/md.txt` (as a source of meme inspiration)

## 7. Revision History:
*   [Date]: Initial Draft

This SOP is a living document and will be updated as the project's understanding of "memes" evolves.
