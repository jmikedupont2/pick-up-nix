## 1.0 Change Description (ITIL)

This Change Request authorizes the initiation of a formal verification project for the replacement of ElizaOS TypeScript plugin functionality with WebAssembly (WASM)-compiled Rust code. This is a strategic change to enhance the reliability, security, and provable correctness of critical system components.

## 2.0 Business Case (Agile)

The current TypeScript implementation of ElizaOS plugins, while functional, lacks the strong guarantees of correctness and memory safety that Rust provides. Furthermore, the ability to formally prove the equivalence and correctness of the Rust replacement using Lean 4 will significantly reduce the risk of subtle bugs, improve system integrity, and establish a new standard for software quality within the project. This will increase developer confidence and reduce long-term maintenance costs.

## 3.0 DMAIC Framework (Six Sigma)

*   **Define:** The problem is the lack of formal guarantees for the correctness and behavior of ElizaOS TypeScript plugins, leading to potential vulnerabilities and unpredictable behavior. The **Customer** is any user or system relying on ElizaOS plugin functionality.
*   **Measure:** We will measure the current state by analyzing existing bug reports related to ElizaOS plugins and the effort required for manual testing and debugging.
*   **Analyze:** The root cause is the inherent limitations of dynamic languages like TypeScript in providing strong, provable guarantees about program behavior, especially concerning memory safety and type correctness.
*   **Improve:** We will improve the system by replacing TypeScript components with Rust-based WASM modules and formally verifying their behavior using Lean 4. This will involve a 42-step verification process as outlined in `INTENT.md`.
*   **Control:** We will control the improved process by integrating formal verification into our CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that all future changes to these critical components are also formally verified.

## 4.0 Architectural Approach (C4)

The replacement will involve developing Rust components that compile to WASM, designed to be binary-compatible with the existing TypeScript interfaces. The formal proof will be conducted using Lean 4, treating both the TypeScript and Rust codebases as inputs for conversion into a Lean-compatible representation.

## 5.0 Quality & Compliance Statement (GMP/ISO 9001)

This project will adhere to the highest standards of software quality and formal methods. All Rust code will be developed with a focus on memory safety and correctness. The formal verification process will provide a provable guarantee of functional equivalence and type compatibility, exceeding standard testing methodologies. This CRQ aligns with ISO 9001 principles for quality management and GMP guidelines for software development.
