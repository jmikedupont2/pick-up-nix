# Change & Quality Request (CRQ): Wiki Import into Memes

**Document ID:** PI-CRQ-00Y, Rev 1.0 (Placeholder ID)
**Applicable Standards:** ITILv4, Agile, OODA, GMP, ISO 9001

---

## 1.0 Change Description (ITIL)

This Change Request authorizes the import of existing wiki content into the project's meme documentation system. The goal is to consolidate project knowledge, enhance discoverability, and integrate valuable information from the wiki into the structured meme format.

## 2.0 Business Case (Agile)

The current project knowledge is fragmented across various platforms, including an external wiki. Consolidating this information into the meme documentation system will improve accessibility, reduce information silos, and provide a single source of truth for project-related concepts and insights. This will streamline onboarding for new team members and facilitate quicker information retrieval for existing ones, ultimately increasing overall project efficiency and knowledge sharing.

## 3.0 DMAIC Framework (Six Sigma)

*   **Define:** The problem is fragmented project knowledge across an external wiki and internal meme documentation, leading to inefficiencies in information retrieval and knowledge sharing. The **Customer** is any project member seeking comprehensive and easily accessible project information.
*   **Measure:** We will measure the current state by assessing the time taken to locate specific project information and the frequency of redundant information requests.
*   **Analyze:** The root cause is the lack of a centralized, unified knowledge base, with critical information residing in an external wiki that is not integrated with the project's primary documentation.
*   **Improve:** We will improve the system by systematically importing relevant wiki content into the meme documentation, categorizing it appropriately, and linking it to existing memes where applicable. This will involve a process of content extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).
*   **Control:** We will control the improved process by establishing guidelines for future knowledge documentation, ensuring that new information is primarily captured within the meme system and that the wiki is either deprecated or its content regularly synchronized.

## 4.0 Architectural Approach (C4)

The import process will involve:
1.  **Extraction:** Utilizing scripts or manual processes to extract content from the wiki.
2.  **Transformation:** Converting wiki content into Markdown format suitable for the meme documentation system, ensuring proper formatting, linking, and categorization.
3.  **Loading:** Placing the transformed content into the `docs/memes/extracted_wiki/` directory (or a similar appropriate location) within the project repository.
Consideration will be given to automating this process where feasible.

## 5.0 Quality & Compliance Statement (GMP/ISO 9001)

The imported content will be reviewed for accuracy, relevance, and adherence to project documentation standards. The process will aim to maintain data integrity and ensure that all critical information from the wiki is successfully migrated. This CRQ aligns with ISO 9001 principles for quality management by improving information accessibility and consistency.
