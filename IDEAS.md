# Nix Introspector: Core Concept

This document outlines the core idea behind the `nix-introspector` tool.

## The Core Idea: A Universal Nix Representation

The central concept is to parse any Nix expression into a universal, intermediate representation, such as S-expressions (sexpr). This representation will serve as a lingua franca for build commands and configurations.

The workflow would be:

1.  **Parse:** Take any Nix file (`flake.nix`, `home.nix`, etc.) and parse it into a canonical `sexpr` form using the `rnix-parser` library.

2.  **Transform:** From this `sexpr` representation, we can then generate equivalent commands or configurations for different systems:
    *   Guix commands
    *   Standard shell scripts
    *   Other configuration formats

## Philosophical Goal

As a philosophical goal, this approach aims to document and model the fundamental "monadic form" of software dependency management: the process of moving from source code to a final, realized binary artifact. By translating between Nix and Guix, we explore the different "syntaxes" for this same underlying "monad" of package management.
